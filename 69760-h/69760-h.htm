<small>THE CHRISTMAS CAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was the day before the day before Christmas,
and there came a big snowstorm,
so that Kenneth and Rose were shut up in
the house. Now that was a very hard thing
to bear, for as every one knows, the last two
days before Christmas are the longest, slowest
days in the whole year. But if one has to stay
in the house and just <i>think</i>, it seems as though
the time would never go by.</p>

<p>If it had been a pleasant day they could
have gone out of doors to skate, or to coast, or
to play any number of jolly games which they
now remembered sadly. Perhaps they would
have gone to their cousin Charlie’s house,
which was in the next block but one beyond
theirs. Perhaps their papa would have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
them down town for a last look at the Christmas
shops, and the wonderful toys, some of
which they hoped Santa Claus would remember
to bring to the Thornton house. There
were ever so many nice things which they
could have done to make the time pass away,
if only it had been a pleasant day. But now
there seemed nothing in the world to do.</p>

<p>Kenneth and Rose wandered dismally about
the house. They peeped into the play-room,
where the toys were lying about looking very
lonely, as though they would say,—</p>

<p>“O Kenneth! Do come and play with us.
Please, Rosie, don’t go away and leave us all
alone!”</p>

<p>But Kenneth and Rose were tired of all
the old toys, they had played with them so
many, many times. They hoped that Santa
would bring them some new ones on Christmas
morning, if Christmas morning would
ever, ever come!</p>

<p>In the dining-room Rose’s old doll, Matilda,
was lying face downward on the sofa, quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
heart-broken because she had been so long
deserted. Rose looked at her, then she turned
her back sadly.</p>

<p>“Matilda is growing very ugly,” she said.
“No wonder she hides her face, with only
one eye and a broken nose. I still love her
very much, but I do so hope that Santa will
not forget how much I need a new dollie.”</p>

<p>They went down into the kitchen, with a
vague hope that Katie might find them something
to do. But Katie was too busy baking
the Christmas pies and cake to bother with
children. She would not even give them a bit
of dough to play with.</p>

<p>“Whisht!” she cried, flapping a dishcloth
at them fiercely, “Rin out o’ me kitchen, you
childer! I can’t have ye fussing about here
this day, niver a bit. Rin off an’ play somewheres
else, like a good little lad and lassie,
now.”</p>

<p>Run off and play! Where should they run,
and what should they play? There was no
one to help them. Papa was down town in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
spite of all the snow. Kenneth wished that
he too was a big man who could go out of
doors in spite of all the snow. Mamma was
busy in the library with secrets of her own,
and would not let them in. Rose wished that
she too was a big lady who could have secrets
all by herself. Then she would not mind
however hard it might storm outside.</p>

<p>Kenneth flattened his nose against one dining-room
window, and Rose flattened her nose
against the other, and they stared out at the
snow smoothly spreading itself over everything,
just as Katie was frosting the cake
downstairs. Big drifts were piling up beyond
the curbstones, and in the doorways opposite.
Now and then a sleigh floundered past, the
horses making their way with difficulty. Supposing,
oh, supposing that it should storm for
two whole days, and the snow should grow
so deep that even Santa Claus’s reindeer could
not get through with the gifts for their Christmas
stockings!</p>

<p>Suddenly Kenneth jumped right up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
air and cried, “Look, Rose!” And at the same
moment Rose pressed her nose even flatter on
the window and said, “O Kenneth, what is
it?”</p>

<p>Something tiny and black was moving along
through the snow on the sidewalk. It gave
little hops, each time sinking down almost
out of sight, stopping to rest between jumps
as though it were very tired. The children
watched it breathlessly.</p>

<p>At last it came to the long flight of steps,
which looked like a smooth toboggan-slide
of snow. But the little black creature seemed
to know what was underneath the cold white
covering, for it hopped bravely up on the lowest
step, then up and up, step by step, to the
landing, where the snow was not so deep. And
now the children could see it plainly.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a poor little kitty!” cried Kenneth,
almost pushing the glass out of the window
with his small, cold nose, so eager was
he to watch the little stranger.</p>

<p>“And she has come to our ownty-donty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
steps!” echoed Rose. “Poor little kitty, how
cold she must be!”</p>

<p>Just at that moment the wet little black
thing looked up at the window where Rose
stood, and just as if she had heard what Rose
said, the poor kitty answered very sadly, “Mi-a-o-ow!”</p>

<p>All this time it had been snowing harder
and harder, and already the tracks which the
kitty had made in the snow were blotted out
of sight. At the same moment Kenneth and
Rose made a dash for the front door. “We
mustn’t let the poor kitty stay there,” said
Kenneth, “she will be all drowned in the
snow, and frozen, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we must bring her in and make her
nice and warm,” said Rose.</p>

<p>So they opened the front door, and stood at
the head of the steps calling, “Kitty, kitty!”
very gently, while the snow whirled in about
their ankles.</p>

<p>“Mi-a-ow!” answered the black cat, but
this time she spoke more cheerfully. “Thank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
you!” she seemed to say. “May I really come
in?”</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Poor kitty, do come in!” cried Rose,
holding out her hand invitingly. And the
black cat walked in.</p>

<p>She was very wet and draggly, but Kenneth
took her in his arms and carried her upstairs.
Rose ran before, and they knocked on the
library door, where their mamma was hidden
with her secrets.</p>

<p>“Mamma, Mamma! Come here a minute!”
they cried. “Come and see what we
have found. Come quick, Mamma!”</p>

<p>In a minute their mamma came hurrying,
and opened the door just a tiny little crack,
through which she peeped at them. But when
she saw what Kenneth had in his arms she
came out quickly, shuttling the door carefully
behind her (to keep the Christmas secrets from
running away, I suppose).</p>

<p>“What have you found, Kenneth?” she
cried, holding up her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“A kitty, a poor kitty, lost in the snow,”
said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“We had to take her in and make her warm
and comfy at Christmas time, didn’t we,
Mamma?” said Rose.</p>

<p>“Please, Mamma, you will let us keep her,
won’t you?” they both pleaded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornton hesitated. The cat was very
wet and homely. She had meant to give the
children a pretty little kitten some day. But
just then the poor hungry animal looked up
and gave a pitiful “Mi-a-ow,” and Mrs.
Thornton remembered how dreadful it was
that any living creature should be miserable
and cold and homeless at the happy Christmas
time.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may keep her, children,” she said.
“Keep her and make her have a merry Christmas.”</p>

<p>Kenneth and Rose took the little cat downstairs
and gave her a good dinner. “But you
shall have a better one on Christmas Day,”
promised Kenneth. Rose found a tiny basket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and made a bed beside the fire in the dining-room.
And there the black cat slept all
the afternoon, she was so tired, and so glad to
rest and to be warm. Rose sat beside her,
stroking her soft fur, and Kenneth sat at the
other side of the fireplace trying to think up
a good name for the new kitty, so that the
time went before they knew it, and they had
forgotten to wish it were Christmas day.</p>

<p>“What have you named the little cat?”
asked their papa when the children showed
him their new pet that evening.</p>

<p>“Oh, Kenneth has thought of the loveliest
name!” cried Rose, jumping up and clapping
her hands. “We are going to call her Christine,—because
she is a little Christmas cat.
Isn’t that a beautiful name, Papa?”</p>

<p>And Papa said that he thought it was a very
beautiful name indeed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE CHRISTMAS CAT’S PRESENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning when Kenneth and
Rose awoke, it was bright and fair. The
storm had cleared away, and the whole world
was white and wonderful with spangled snow.
Now the children could play out of doors as
much as they liked, and the time went so fast
that they almost forgot to wish Christmas
would hurry up. Their cousin Charlie came
over to play with them, and they built snow
forts and snowballed one another; they made
big statues of snow in the back yard and shoveled
the sidewalks and the front steps nicely.
Before they knew it it was evening again,—Christmas
eve, and their mamma was inviting
them to come and see her secret in the
library.</p>

<p>And what do you think the secret was?
When the folding doors were thrown open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
there was a glare of light and a smell of
woodsy green, and Kenneth and Rose and
their cousin Charlie cried “Oh!” they were
so surprised. For there stood a beautiful
Christmas tree, glittering with spangles and
icicles and silver balls and tiny candles.</p>

<p>Kenneth and Rose and Charlie danced
around the tree, and they had a beautiful time
finding the little bags of candy which were
hidden for each of them among the green
branches.</p>

<p>“It was a lovely, lovely secret,” whispered
Rose in her mamma’s ear. “And when I grow
up I will make one just like it for my dolls.”</p>

<p>When all the candles had sputtered and
gone out, Charlie’s papa came to take him
home. And after that it was time to go to bed.
But first they must hang up their stockings
for Santa Claus to fill. They tied them up
over the fireplace in the library,—Kenneth’s
long black stocking and Rose’s shorter brown
one. Then Kenneth said,—</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma, we must hang up a stocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
for Christine. I am sure Santa will want
to remember the poor little Christmas cat.”</p>

<p>“I know!” cried Rose. “I will hang up
one of my little summer socks. That will be
just right for a little kitty-cat’s Christmas.”</p>

<p>So she brought one of her short white socks
and they hung it up in the chimney-place
right between the other two stockings,—between
Kenneth’s and Rose’s. And Christine
looked pleased. Then everybody said good-night,
and the children went to bed.</p>

<p>It was very, very early in the morning when
Kenneth opened his eyes and said out loud, “It
is Christmas Day! Oh, at last it is Christmas
Day!” Then his eyes opened very wide indeed,
and he said nothing at all. The bedposts
looked so queer!</p>

<p>Kenneth scrambled over and examined them.
On each post at the foot of the bed was a big
yellow orange. These were the first signs of
Christmas, and they kept Kenneth busy for
some minutes. But when he had eaten one of
the oranges he could not wait any longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>He ran to Rose’s room and thumped on the
door. “Merry Christmas, Rose! Wake up!”
he cried, poking in his head. But already Rose
was wide awake, and was sitting up in bed
eating one of the oranges which had grown
on her bedposts, too, during the night.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas yourself,” cried Rose,
jumping out of bed. “Let us run and wake
up papa and mamma.”</p>

<p>So they trotted down the hall to mamma’s
room and thumped on the door. “Merry
Christmas, Mamma! Merry Christmas, Papa!”
they cried. “We are going down to look at
our stockings and see whether or not Santa
really did come last night.”</p>

<p>Papa and mamma sighed a little, for they
were still very sleepy. But mamma said, “Well,
children, you may go down. But first you
must put on your clothes, so that you will not
take cold. Papa and I will be there in a little
while.”</p>

<p>Kenneth was dressed first. He ran downstairs
to the library, and sure enough! there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
hung the three stockings, bulgy and knobby
and queer. He shouted up the stairs, “Oh,
Rose! Hurry, hurry! He really came,
Santa Claus came, and he did not forget even
Christine.”</p>

<p>In a minute down came Rose, with her
shoes half buttoned and her curls all tangled.
She could not wait this morning to make
everything just right.</p>

<p>They seized their stockings and sat down
on the floor to pull out the “plums,” like
little Jack Horner. In Kenneth’s stocking
he found a big red apple, and a bag of lovely
marbles. Under these was a new game in a
box, and a horn of candy. Kenneth dived
down lower and found a toy cart, and a top,
and a baby camera. At last he reached the
toe of the stocking, where there was just one
thing left. “I think it is a stick of candy,”
said Kenneth. But when it came out, it was
a jack-knife with four blades. You can imagine
how pleased Kenneth was.</p>

<p>As for Rose, what do you suppose she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
found in her stocking? She had a red apple,
too, and a horn of candy. Then there was a
cunning pocket-book, and a little coral necklace
in a velvet box. There was a red rubber
ball and a harmonica, and away down in the
little brown toe of her stocking hid a tiny
doll’s watch and chain. But the best gift of
all poked its head out of the top of her
stocking and smiled at her the very first thing.
It was a lovely little doll, with yellow curls
like Rose’s own, and blue eyes, and a white
dress with blue ribbons.</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear doll!” cried Rose, hugging
her tightly. “I knew that Santa would bring
you to me! You are ever so much prettier
than Matilda, and I shall call you Alice.”</p>

<p>Now Papa and Mamma came down, and
they were eager to see what was in Christine’s
stocking. “Let us take it down to
the dining-room where Christine is,” said
Mamma. “Katie tells me that there are some
queer-looking bundles there for you, which
Santa could not crowd into your stockings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>With a whoop of joy Kenneth ran down
the stairs to the dining-room, and Rose followed
as fast as she could, carrying the little
white sock with the presents for the Christmas
cat. She went up to the basket beside
the fire, where Christine lay just as they had
left her the night before.</p>

<p>“Oh, Kitty, see what Santa has brought
you,” said Rose, holding out the little bulgy
stocking. Then she stared hard into the
basket where Christine lay. “Oh-h-h! Kenneth!”
she cried. “Come here quick! See
what Santa has brought the Christmas cat!”</p>

<p>For there, cuddled close up against Christine’s
black fur, were two tiny round things
mewing with baby voices; one little black
kitten, and one as yellow as Rose’s curls, both
with their eyes shut tight.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” said papa. “Santa could
not get those into Kitty’s stocking, so he
brought them here. Isn’t it a lovely present
for a little Christmas cat?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i031">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“SEE WHAT SANTA HAS BROUGHT THE CHRISTMAS CAT”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Of course they both belong to Christine,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
said Kenneth, “but may I not call one of
them mine, and the other one Rose’s?”</p>

<p>“I want the yellow one,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“I like the black one best,” said Kenneth,
“so that is all right.” But Christine licked
both the kittens with her pink tongue and
purred happily.</p>

<p>“I like them both best, and they are both
mine,” she seemed to say.</p>

<p>Then the children took out the presents
from the little white sock. There was a pretty
collar and a bow of ribbon,—yellow, which
was Christine’s most becoming color. And
there was a little bunch of catnip instead of
candy. Santa seemed to know just what a
little cat would best like. But nothing seemed
to please Christine so much as the tiny balls
of black and yellow fur in her basket. And
the children did not blame her. For indeed,
of all their Christmas gifts,—except Alice,
the new doll, and Kenneth’s jack-knife,—they
each liked best the kitten which they
had chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“I shall call my kitten Buff,” said Rose,
touching the little yellow ball gently.</p>

<p>“And mine shall be Fluff,” said Kenneth,
who liked to make rhymes sometimes. “Oh,
I am so glad that we took Christine in out
of the snow, Rose! For if we hadn’t, perhaps
Santa would never have thought of
leaving us these dear little kittens.”</p>

<p>And I shouldn’t wonder if Kenneth was
right.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE JAPANESE SHOP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day, not very long after Christmas,
Mrs. Thornton said to Rose,—</p>

<p>“Rose, dear, I am going to the Japanese
Shop to buy a wedding present, and I think
you would like to go, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“What is a Japanese Shop?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is a very wonderful shop,” said her
mamma. “I can’t begin to tell you about all
the curious things which they sell in a Japanese
Shop. You must come and see for yourself.”</p>

<p>So Rose put on her hat and coat and went
with her mother to the Japanese Shop. What
a wonderful place it was, indeed! Rose felt
just as if she were in some strange, new kind
of Fairyland, such as she had never before
heard about. Everything was colored so bright
and beautiful! There were such queer-shaped
things sitting about on the floor and standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
up in the corners! Curious lanterns swung
from the ceiling, and tall screens of black and
gold, with pictures of wonderful long-legged
birds flying across, made dark nooks, in which
strange bronze animals lurked surprisingly.
Everything smelt sweet and rich, too, almost
with the Christmas-tree fragrance of mamma’s
holiday secret.</p>

<p>Rose wandered about by herself while her
mother was looking at the funny lamps hiding
under colored umbrellas, which she called
wedding presents, though Rose did not understand
why. They did not interest her like
Christmas presents, which were very different.
But over in a corner, all by itself, Rose found
something which she thought would make
the loveliest Christmas present,—the most
wonderful Christmas present that any little
girl could have. And oh! how she wanted
it for her very own!</p>

<p>It was a toy garden; the kind that is put
into the guest-room of a Japanese house to
amuse visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>My! It was a wonderful little garden,—a
real, truly live garden, with growing trees and
plants and moss. But it was all so tiny that
it could stand on a little table no wider than
Rose’s arm was long. And though the trees
were really, truly grown-up trees, a great deal
older than Rose,—older even than her mamma,
whom Rose thought very old indeed,—they
were no taller than Rose’s little hand.</p>

<p>This is the way the garden looked. First,
it was almost square and there was a little stone
wall all around it, about an inch high. In the
middle of the garden was a hill built of rocks,
and on the top of the hill was a lawn of green
moss, with a tiny pagoda, or Japanese house,
no bigger than a match-box. The sides of the
hill sloped down, very green and smooth, and
at the foot was a little brook of real water,
winding around the whole garden. The tiniest
path of sand crept zig-zag down the hill to a
bit of a red bridge that crossed the brook, for
the people in the house at the top of the hill
to use. And all along the brook grew little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
baby plants, and the wonderful dwarf trees
that I told you about. Pine-trees they were,
most of them, and the pine needles had fallen
on the ground and had turned rusty brown,
just as everyday pine needles do. Only these
were ten times smaller. Rose wondered who
lived in the little house at the top of the hill,
and she said to herself:—</p>

<p>“Oh, how I wish I were little enough to
live in that dear little house, and play in that
sweet little garden, and climb up into those
darling little trees! Oh, how I wish I could
be littler!” And that was something which
Rose had never before wished.</p>

<p>Just then Rose heard a cough behind her,
and looking around she saw that the funny
Japanese Man who kept the store was standing
close at her elbow. He was smiling very pleasantly,
so Rose said to him:—</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Japanese Man! I think you can
tell me who lives in the dear little house and
plays in the dear little garden and paddles in
the dear little brook. Will you, please?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>The Japanese Man bowed and grinned, and
looked at Rose for a minute without saying
anything. Then he went away to the other
end of the store. Presently he came back, and
he had something in his hands. He set a little
Somebody down beside the house on the top
of the hill; and it was a tiny little old man
made of china-stuff, in a long green gown,
with a knob of hair on the back of his head,
like a lady.</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> live in house, litty ol’ man,” said the
Japanese. “And these, his animals; live in
garden.” As he said this the Japanese Man
set down on the bridge the littlest baby white
rabbit, and in the brook a tiny-winy duck,
which floated on the water, and under one
of the trees a wee-wee mouse, with pink
ears.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Rose, clapping her hands.
“Oh! how I wish I could be little enough
to play there with them. Are they alive, Mr.
Japanese Man?”</p>

<p>The Man grinned more than ever. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
he came close up to Rose and whispered
behind his hand, as though it were a great
secret:—</p>

<p>“No, not alive <i>now</i>. But after dark, when
moon shines, and store all empty—all big
folks gone away—then all come alive. My—my!
Litty ol’ man walk down hill, go
fishy in brook. Duck say ‘<i>Quack quack!</i>’
Litty rabbit hop so-so over bridge. Litty
mouse cry ‘<i>Wee, wee!</i>’ and climb up pine-tree.
My! Litty girl like to see?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Have <i>you</i> ever seen?” cried Rose
with her eyes very wide.</p>

<p>But just then her mamma came back, with
a bundle under her arm, which was probably
a little Wedding Present, though Rose did
not care enough about it to inquire. But
she was very sorry when the Japanese Man
bowed politely and walked away to the other
end of the store. She had wanted to ask him
a great many more questions.</p>

<p>“Come, Rose,” said her mother; “we must
go home now.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE LITTLEST BABY WHITE RABBIT</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“O Mamma! I want it!” sighed Rose wistfully.</p>

<p>“Want what? The garden? Oh, my Dear! I
cannot buy you that,” said her mamma sadly;
“it costs dollars and dollars. But maybe I
could buy you the mouse, or the duck, or the
rabbit, or the little old gentleman up there.
Would you like one of them, Dear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” cried Rose. “It would be
dreadful to take them away from their lovely
garden. I wouldn’t have one of them for
anything. Think how lonesome he would be
when it grew dark and they all came alive!”</p>

<p>On the way home Rose told her mamma
the great secret, which the Japanese Man had
told her. And her mamma thought it was all
very strange indeed, and said she wished that
she too was little enough to play in the wonderful
garden with Rose and that interesting
family.</p>

<p>When they reached home Rose told Kenneth
all about the toy garden, and the secret
which the Japanese Man had told her. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Kenneth only said, “Pooh! I don’t believe a
word of it,” which was very disappointing.
But, of course, Kenneth had not seen the
garden, nor heard the Japanese Man tell the
secret, which made a great difference.</p>

<p>When it was dark Rose went to bed, and
in a little while her mamma came to kiss her
good-night. Rose held her tightly by the
hand and made her sit down on the edge of
the bed, where the moonlight shone like silver.</p>

<p>“O Mamma!” she whispered. “Think of
the shop, all dark and empty now, with just
one moonbeam shining on the little garden
in the corner. And the little old man comes
alive, <i>pop</i>! like that! Now he goes walking
out of his house, down the little path over
the hill. And the bunny-rabbit scampers in
front of him, <i>hoppity-hop</i>! Can’t you see him,
Mamma? Now they come to the little bridge;
the funny duck says ‘<i>Quack, quack!</i>’ and
swims away round and round the garden.
Now the little old man sits down under one
of the tiny pine-trees and begins to fish in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
brook. And the wee-wee mouse runs up and
down the tree and nibbles the cheese which
the old man has in his pocket for bait. O
Mamma, I can see it all, just as plainly! I
wish I were there.”</p>

<p>“I can almost see it, too,” said Mamma.</p>

<p>“O Mamma, I think I could grow little
just as easily as they could come alive. Don’t
you?” said Rose.</p>

<p>Her mother answered, “We-el, perhaps.”</p>

<p>But she would never take Rose to the Japanese
shop after dark, to see whether or not
it could be done. Maybe she was afraid that
Rose might grow little and stay little always—which
would have been a dreadful thing
for her mamma. But Rose thinks that she
herself would like it very well indeed,—to
live always in that wonderful garden with
the mouse and the duck and the rabbit and
the funny little old man,—if only Kenneth
would grow little, too. But Kenneth does
not want to grow little. He is trying just as
hard as he can, every day, to grow big.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>APRIL FOOL’S NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the night of April Fool’s day Kenneth
had a strange adventure. It was
Kenneth’s way to direct his dreamland journey
toward Fairyland, where, if he but knows
the secret how, a child can have the pleasantest
possible times. On this particular night
Kenneth shut his eyes tight and said the
magic words which are the ticket on the
Fairy Railroad; and presto! as usual, he
found himself spinning through space into
the realm where he would be. He kept his
eyes shut tight, however, for every wise child
knows that he must not peep during that
wonderful journey, nor try to find out how it
is done, or he will never be able to go again.
It was only when a soft little jounce told him
that the trip was over that Kenneth opened
his eyes and ventured to look around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Yes, there he was, sure enough! He
remembered the glittering Christmas-tree
avenue which led up from the station. He
remembered the beautiful flower beds on
either side of the path—fairy beds where the
flowers could talk prettily, and answer any
questions which a child might ask. He remembered
the white marble palace which
gleamed beyond the Christmas trees, a palace
full of wonder and delight. He hastened
toward it up the hill. Yes, this was certainly
the Fairyland of his dreams, where he always
had such a lovely, lovely time; where all
that he wished came true in the most marvelous
way, and where delightful surprises
were continually happening to give him pleasure.
Kenneth smacked his lips already at
thought of the goodies he would have to eat,
and his fingers wriggled eagerly, longing to
clutch the wonder-toys which he knew were
growing somewhere about for him, when he
had time to look for them.</p>

<p>Now there was no one to meet him at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
station, and Kenneth thought this strange.
For he had expected to find his usual guide,
a pretty little gauze fairy in spangled white,
with a wand and crown and all the dainty
ornaments which fairies wear. Kenneth was
not greatly troubled, however, for he had
been to Fairyland so often that he knew the
country very well indeed, and he was not at
all bashful nor afraid to help himself if he
should see anything which pleased him.</p>

<p>He began briskly to walk up the avenue, on
either side of which the flowers nodded and
smiled at him, saying, “Good evening, Kenneth.
How are you to-night?”</p>

<p>Kenneth laughed and nodded back, thinking
to himself, “How very pretty they look!
I never before saw them so gorgeous and
beautiful. They must be perfumed with extra
sweetness; I will go and see.” And, stepping
up to a great bed of lilies, he bent over them,
giving a deep, deep sniff; for Kenneth loved
dearly the fragrance of flowers.</p>

<p>“Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!” Kenneth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
sneezed, and sneezed again, so that his head
almost fell off. “Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!”
He reeled and staggered as he turned away.
And all the flowers laughed so that they
nearly snapped their slender stalks. They
seemed to find it a great joke.</p>

<p>“You dreadful flowers! You are full of
snuff! Achoo!” he cried indignantly.</p>

<p>“Aha! Aha! You know all about it!”
cried the flowers. “The trick is not new to
you; but is it not funny? Aha! Aha!”</p>

<p>Kenneth did not think it at all funny as
he ran on up the pathway, sneezing painfully
at every step. At last he paused to wipe his
eyes. “Achoo! Achoo!” Poor boy! He was
fairly weak with his efforts, and spying a
little seat near by under a tree, thought he
would sit down to rest a minute and get
his breath before going on his way. It was a
funny little seat, like a great toadstool, and it
looked very comfortable. But no sooner had
Kenneth seated himself, than the wretched
thing sank down into the ground, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
him with a bump on the gravel of the
avenue.</p>

<p>“Aha! Aha!” cried the flowers, tittering
foolishly when they saw Kenneth sprawling.
“Oh, how funny you do look! What a good
joke! How clever! We shall die laughing!”</p>

<p>“You are very silly flowers,” said Kenneth,
pouting. “You laugh at nothing at all. I
never knew you to be so disagreeable.” And,
trying to look very dignified in spite of his
dusty jacket, he jumped up and strode down
the avenue. The inviting little round seats
seemed to have sprung up everywhere like
mushrooms since his last visit, but he was too
cautious to sit down again, although he was
very tired.</p>

<p>Kenneth walked so fast to escape the mortifying
laughter which rang from the flower-bells,
that he had almost passed the last
Christmas tree before he remembered the
magic fruit which they always bore for him.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried. “I meant to look for
a new jack-knife. I always find just what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
want on these trees. Why, yes—there is
one now, right over my head. Oh, what a
beauty!” He reached up to grasp it as it
swung about a foot above his nose. But at the
very moment when Kenneth stretched out his
hand, the tree gave a sudden jerk and up flew
the knife quite out of reach.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Kenneth, stamping his foot
angrily. “What made it do that?”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” snickered the flowers, who had
been peeping at him from a distance. “What
a joke! Try again, Kenneth.” And Kenneth
tried again and again, jumping after the knife
more frantically each time. But it was of no
use. A malicious breeze, or some other cause,
seemed to bend the tree away from him whenever
he reached toward it. And at last he
gave up in disgust.</p>

<p>“I wanted a fountain pen, too,” he said to
himself. “There ought to be one on another
tree. Yes, here it is.” And once more Kenneth
reached eagerly for the shining black
thing that dangled close by his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Pop! Kenneth was half blinded by a
stream of water that spurted into his eye. It
was no fountain pen, but a fountain pop-gun
that had gone off when he touched it.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” shrieked the flowers, in a perfect
madness of delight. Kenneth sat down
on the grass to wipe his eyes and dry the
little river that was running most uncomfortably
up his coat sleeve. But my! How
quickly he sprang up again! The grass that
looked so tempting and soft was a cruel snare.
For some one had wickedly planted it with
pins or needles. Poor Kenneth! This was
too much.</p>

<p>It is no fun to find one’s self a human pincushion.
He began to cry, and even then he
heard the voices of the flowers sounding
faintly, and they were laughing still. He
glanced toward them angrily, then tucked his
hands into his pockets and resolved not to let
them see him cry. He marched away up the
avenue without a glance into the Christmas
trees, although they dangled the most interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
bundles before his face and seemed
trying to tempt him to pluck their magic
fruit. He also kept off the grass more carefully
than if there had been a staring signboard
to warn him.</p>

<p>Now just outside the palace grew a thicket
of magic nut bushes. Here Kenneth always
stopped on his way to the greater wonders
inside, to crack a nut and to have a pleasant
surprise. Yes, there at the foot of the marble
steps was the thicket, green as usual, and full
of brown nuts, mysteriously knobby and promising.
Kenneth picked one and knelt down
on the gravel to crack it with a stone. But
instead of the beautiful velvet cloak, magically
folded into a tiny parcel, or a dwarf pony
which would quickly grow full-sized, or a
picture-book with moving figures on its pages,
such as he had found at other times, the nut
was stuffed with dusty cobwebs, which were
of no use to any one, least of all to Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Kenneth, in disappointment,
and then he distinctly heard a queer voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
cry, “April Fool!” He looked up and
around, but there was no one to be seen.</p>

<p>“April Fool!” cried the voice again. “Ha,
ha! Kenneth has <i>such</i> a sense of fun! He is
a great joker himself; ha, ha!” Kenneth
thought it must be one of the flowers, though
the voice sounded different. He wished the
good Fairy would come to him. His chin
began to quiver, when he heard the same
queer voice tittering behind the thicket of
nut bushes. There was a little summer-house
close by, and into this Kenneth ran to hide
the tears which would come into his eyes.
What a disagreeable country it was, this
Fairyland which he had loved so well! He
came here to be happy; but all these ugly
tricks fairly spoiled the pretty place. He said
to himself that he would never come again.
Just then he spied a large, square envelope
fastened to the side of the summer-house by
a thorn. It was addressed, “For Kenneth.”</p>

<p>“Why, that means me,” he cried, very
much surprised. “Perhaps it is a letter from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
my good Fairy to explain why she has not
come to meet me.” And he tore it open
eagerly.</p>

<p>It was a fat, bulky letter of several sheets.
This was very exciting, for Kenneth had not
received many letters in his short life. He
unfolded the first sheet. From the middle of
the page stared at him these words printed in
huge red letters:—</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large">APRIL FOOL!</span></p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE APRIL FOOL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">KENNETH looked at it angrily, then
turned over the other pages. They
were just the same as the first one. He tore
up the sheets and threw them on the ground.
It was only an April Fool letter, after all!</p>

<p>“April Fool!” cried a voice, echoing the
same hateful words. “April Fool! Ha! ha!
What a joke!” It was a funny little voice,
louder than those of the flowers, and, instead
of being silvery sweet like theirs, it was harsh
and disagreeable. Kenneth glanced up, and
there, perched on the railing of the summer-house,
was the queerest little fellow, making
the most horrible faces. With a bound the
figure sprang inside, and Kenneth saw him
more clearly. He was certainly a fairy, for
he had wings, gauzy and beautiful, growing
from his shoulders. But his dress was unlike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
that of any fairy whom Kenneth had met.
It reminded him, however, of pictures that
he had sometimes seen in books. This fairy
wore a suit half of red and half of yellow;
one leg and one shoe were red and the other
yellow. His doublet was divided likewise,
and likewise the funny hood which he wore
about his shoulders. The borders of his costume
were cut into points, and from every
point hung a little bell that jingled and jangled
mischievously whenever the imp moved
about—which was continually. His cap had
two long pointed ears, and in his hand he
carried a wand, on the end of which was a
copy of himself dressed in red and yellow,
and tinkly with many bells. He was a very
funny figure, and his mouth stretched from
ear to ear in a grin which made Kenneth
laugh, too. But Kenneth soon stopped laughing;
for there was something about the imp’s
smile that was not kindly, and that made one
half afraid.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Kenneth, trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
seem very bold. “And what are you laughing
at? I don’t see anything so very funny at
this moment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you?” grinned the imp.
“April Fool! I do. I am April Fool. Why,
don’t you know me?” And turning around
he showed Kenneth a large placard, such as
he had himself often made, pinned to one
of the points of the imp’s doublet. “<span class="smcap">April
Fool</span>!” it read. Kenneth began to understand.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are April Fool, are you?” he
said. “I never saw you before.”</p>

<p>“Ho! You never <i>saw</i> me? No, but you
have used my name often enough. You remember
April Fool’s day every year? Aha!
Those were good tricks you played, though
to be sure most of them were old enough—old
as I am, and that <i>is</i> old indeed, I can tell
you, my little joker. But they are good jokes,
are they not? One never tires of them, does
one?” And again he grinned at Kenneth
maliciously.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“N-no,” said Kenneth, doubtfully, looking
again at the pieces of the torn April
Fool letter and rubbing his eyes, which still
smarted from the snuff. “But I think jokes
are funnier when one looks on, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed the imp. “That is
the best joke of all. Why, some folk seem to
think as you do. But not I! Now I love a
good joke for its own sake better than anything
else in the world. I am always in it,
for <i>I am</i> the joke itself. Ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“Then it is you who have made all these
things happen to me,” said Kenneth angrily.
“What do you mean by it?”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! Don’t you know what night
it is? To-morrow is the first of April! What
can you expect in Fairyland except the very
biggest of jokes? This is my night. But
come, now, don’t be sulky. It is only a joke
after all, and you are such a joker yourself that
you ought to take these little matters very
cheerfully. Come with me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to come with you,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Kenneth, hanging back. “I want to go
home.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, you cannot go home yet,” answered
the imp. “It is not nearly morning.
Now that you have come you must stay
here until the time is up.”</p>

<p>“Then I want my good Fairy guide,” said
Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Ho!” cried the other in scorn. “She is
too silly-kind, too goody-goody. She has no
real sense of fun, poor thing.”</p>

<p>“I like her fun best,” insisted Kenneth.
“Please take me to her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said April Fool carelessly.
“If you insist I will bring you to her.
But first you must have something to eat, for
it is a long journey. Are you not hungry,
poor boy?”</p>

<p>Kenneth confessed that he was very hungry.
“Then we will go to the kitchen garden,”
replied the imp; “and there you can feast as
much as you like.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I have been to the kitchen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
garden,” cried Kenneth, brightening. “The
good Fairy took me there; it is a lovely
place!”</p>

<p>He followed April Fool out of the summer-house
into a narrow path leading on and on
and on between green hedgerows full of blossoms.
Overhead the birds sang sweetly, and
the sky was blue. Kenneth began to feel very
happy. At last, in the distance, he caught
sight of the kitchen garden, as he well remembered
it, with its tall pie-fruit trees, its
cooky bushes, its eclair plants, and its ice-cream
fountains. The glimpse made him so
hungry that he could hardly wait to be there,
and he ran ahead, outstripping April Fool
himself.</p>

<p>“That is right! Hurry, my boy!” cried
the imp heartily. And Kenneth skipped on
happily. But suddenly <i>bump</i>! went his head
and his knee against something hard, and he
came to a dizzy stop, hardly knowing what
had happened. There lay the kitchen garden
just beyond, but something had stopped him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
and would not let him pass, something which
he could not see.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! April Fool again!” laughed the
imp, holding his sides for merriment. “Don’t
you see through this joke? Why, it is perfectly
transparent.”</p>

<p>Sure enough! Kenneth put out his hand,
and found that it was a wall of glass, which
stretched across the path from hedge to hedge;
a gateless wall which he could by no means
climb over, but through which he could
plainly see all the dainties on the other side.
Kenneth groaned. “Oh, I am so hungry!
What a cruel, cruel joke!”</p>

<p>“Jokes do seem cruel sometimes,” admitted
April Fool; “but they are <i>such</i> fun!
Oh, my, oh, my! How queer you did look
when you bumped against that wall!” and
he burst out laughing once more.</p>

<p>“Well, are you going to let me in?” asked
Kenneth, trying to keep his temper, though
he thought the joke in very poor taste, like
most of April Fool’s tricks.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i065">
<img class="w100" src="images/i065.jpg" alt="KENNETH FOUND THAT IT WAS A WALL OF GLASS">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">KENNETH FOUND THAT IT WAS A WALL OF GLASS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Oh, no, we cannot enter here,” said the
imp. “This is only an impracticable window.
We shall have to go around by another way,
a détour of some miles. But this time I really
promise to take you to the kitchen garden.”</p>

<p>Kenneth was very angry, but he began to
suspect that he must let April Fool have his
own way on this night. They turned back
down the narrow path and began a long, tiresome
journey round about and round about
to the garden which they had already seen so
near.</p>

<p>And what a journey that was! beset by so
many surprises, shocks, and practical jokes that
Kenneth was nearly frantic before they had
seen the end. They were crossing a bridge
over a pretty little stream, when in the middle—<i>crash</i>!
The whole structure gave way,
and down they fell, with a sickening sinking
feeling—fully three feet! Then the bridge
came to rest on the magic springs which were
made to complete this jouncy joke. After this
their way led through a pitch-black cavern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
which was so silent that Kenneth could hear
his heart beat as he felt his way along. Suddenly
there was an awful roar, like the growl
of hundreds of wild beasts let loose. Kenneth
screamed with fright, but the imp cried out,
“April Fool!” And immediately the cave
was filled with light, showing only an innocent
sound-machine which had made all this
commotion.</p>

<p>They came within sight of a broad brook,
which the imp said they must cross. Kenneth
took off his shoes and stockings to wade and
stepped down to the margin. But what was
his anger to find that it was only a wide mirror
over which they were able to pass dry-shod.
That was a famous joke, to judge by
the imp’s shrieks of laughter when he saw
Kenneth put out his foot to wade into the
glassy stream. But Kenneth had become so
tired of such fun that he did not even smile.</p>

<p>Kenneth grew thirsty, and they stopped to
drink at a fountain which gushed clear and
sparkling by the wayside. But at the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
draught Kenneth found his mouth full of
horrid, briny water, such as one swallows by
mistake when one is bathing in the sea. Poor
boy! This made him all the thirstier, but
he was resolved not to show April Fool how
wretched and unhappy he really was.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE APRIL-FOOL JOURNEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT last, however, when Kenneth was so
tired and faint that he could hardly walk
another step, they came to the kitchen garden.
There were the pie trees and the raspberry
shrubs, the caramel plants and the bonbon
hedge, brown with luscious chocolates.</p>

<p>“Now, help yourself,” said the imp cordially.
And without further invitation Kenneth
fell to. A fine cream pie lay under one
of the trees, from which it had just fallen.
Kenneth cut a wedge out of it with the knife
which was sticking conveniently in the tree-trunk,
and began to eat it ravenously. But
faugh! What dreadful stuff! It was frosted
with soapsuds instead of whipped cream!</p>

<p>“April Fool!” cried the imp, dancing
up and down, for this was the best joke of
all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Oh!” whimpered Kenneth, “I hope
they are not all April-Fool goodies.” And he
ran to the next tree. But a bite was all he
needed to prove that he must not trust his eyes
this April Fool’s night. The mince pies were
made of sand and sawdust, with pebbles for
plums. The sponge cake was indeed a real
sponge. The doughnuts were of India rubber;
they might be fine for a teething baby to bite,
but they were a poor lunch for a hungry boy.
The griddle-cakes were rounds of leather,
nicely browned on both sides. The salad was
made of tissue paper; the chocolates were
stuffed with cotton wool and other horrid
stuff; while the maple sugar, upon which
Kenneth was perfectly sure he could rely,
turned out to be yellow soap—clean, but not
appetizing.</p>

<p>Even the eggs, growing innocently white
upon the egg-plant, turned out to be hollow
mockeries; some humorous little boy seemed
to have blown their insides away, as a great
joke. Once Kenneth would have thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
a very funny idea. But now he sat down and
cried and cried, he was so disappointed and
so hungry.</p>

<p>“Boo hoo! Boo hoo!” sobbed Kenneth.
“I want to go home. I don’t like Fairyland
one bit!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed the imp. “April Fool!
This isn’t Fairyland at all; this is April Fool
Land, and you are <i>It</i>. But come, I really think
you have had enough of it. I will take you
to the true Fairyland, and give you over to
your kind, good, serious Fairy guide. Shall
we go? <i>One, two, three—out goes he!</i>” And
with a snap of his fingers, Kenneth found himself
outside the tantalizing kitchen garden,
walking toward his good Fairy’s real, truly
palace, which gleamed comfortingly through
the trees.</p>

<p>At first he dared not think that it was really
so; he suspected another joke of April Fool’s.
But at last he spied the good Fairy herself,
standing at the top of the long flight of marble
steps which led up to the palace. Kenneth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
ran forward and waved his hand eagerly, he
was so anxious to exchange guides and to be
rid of the hateful imp. But the Fairy did not
seem to see him. She was shading her eyes
with her hand and looking off over the Christmas
trees, appearing troubled.</p>

<p>“Humph!” growled the imp. “There she
is, looking for you. And how eager you are
to leave me, now that you have enjoyed all
the jokes I had to play. Well, good-by! You
have only to walk up the staircase to your
goody-goody Fairy, and you will be safe from
me. I cannot pass into that palace, where the
fun is of a different kind from mine.”</p>

<p>“It is a great deal nicer than yours, for it is
always kind,” retorted Kenneth, “and yet it
is just as funny.”</p>

<p>“Very well, go and look for it, then,” cried
the imp, and without another word he disappeared.</p>

<p>Kenneth was much relieved to see him go.
He set his foot on the lowest stair and eagerly
began the ascent of the marble flight. But no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
sooner had he lifted his foot to the second step
than the staircase itself began to move under
him, so that he had to step quickly to keep
from falling. Horrible! What did this mean?
“April Fool!” cried a voice behind him.
“Ha! ha! It is my last joke, and it is a rare
good one. You are on a treadmill staircase,
Kenneth. You must climb fast or you will
fall down and be ground up inside the machine.
Hurrah! Step lively, please! Quicker,
quicker! Maybe you will reach the top by
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>Kenneth had to work his little legs faster
and faster and faster, as the great staircase
revolved under him. Yet however he strove
he reached never a step nearer the top, but
remained always in the same spot. And the
Fairy still looked away over the tops of the
Christmas trees, without seeing him.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed the imp; but his voice
was fainter than it had been, and Kenneth
hoped it was fading away. The poor boy was
so exhausted that he felt he could not keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
up for long. His legs ached and his head
ached dizzily, and his poor back, bent over
the whirling staircase, ached most of all. “I
cannot bear it,” he said to himself, panting
and out of breath. “I cannot move my legs
any faster. I cannot breathe. I must sit down,
even if I do go under to be ground into little
pieces.”</p>

<p>Without more ado Kenneth sat down on
the staircase, closing his eyes and shuddering
with fear of what might happen next. But
what happened? The staircase merely stopped
with a jerk—and stood still.</p>

<p>“April Fool!” cried the far-off voice of
the imp. “You might have done it long ago.
April Fool—Fool—Fool!” and the voice
faded away into a mere sigh of the breeze.</p>

<p>At the same moment Kenneth heard a sweet
call from the top of the staircase. “Kenneth,
Kenneth!” it said, in silvery tones quite unlike
the imp’s harsh ones. And, looking up, he saw
his good Fairy coming swiftly down the staircase
toward him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Oh, good Fairy,” sobbed Kenneth, “I
have had such a dreadful time looking for
you! Please stay by me, and do not let that
bad, bad April Fool find me again.”</p>

<p>The good Fairy leaned over Kenneth and
put her hand on his head. “Poor boy!” she
said. “Has April Fool been playing his tricks
on you? This was his night, you know. He
said you were a friend of his, so we had to let
him have his joke with you. He is indeed a
horrid fellow, and I hope he is no longer your
friend.”</p>

<p>“No, he will never be my friend again,”
cried Kenneth.</p>

<p>“I like my own kind of jokes a great deal
better,” said the Fairy: “pleasant surprises, unexpected
kindnesses, pain turned into pleasure,
and disappointment into joy. One can play
those jokes all through the year. But it is too
late for any of them to-night. You must go
back home now, Kenneth.”</p>

<p>“I am quite ready to go,” said Kenneth
wearily, for even a pleasant joke had no charms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
for him now, he was so tired. The Fairy took
him by the hand and led him back to the
station. They passed the magic nut bushes,
but Kenneth did not pause. They walked
under the tempting Christmas trees, but he
did not look up. They went between the
rows of flowers, gently tittering on either side,
but Kenneth did not so much as glance at
them. The kind Fairy held his hand, and
April Fool could play no tricks upon him
now.</p>

<p>At the station the Fairy guide kissed Kenneth
sweetly, and closed his eyes with her
wand. “Come again to-morrow night,” she
murmured, “and naughty April Fool will be
gone for another year. Then you shall come
into my palace and we will play some happy
tricks.”</p>

<p>Then she spoke the magic words of his
return ticket, and Kenneth, with his eyes
closed, felt a spring, a rush, and a whirling
about his head. But he never peeped until
he felt once more the gentle jounce that told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
him the end of his journey had come. Then
with his fists he rubbed his eyes and, winking
sleepily, opened them to find himself snugly
lying in bed, with the morning sun shining
into his window.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THE DOLLS’ MAY-PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALICE had never gone to a party before.
Of course Rose, who was almost six
years old, had gone to a great many. But
Alice, who was her newest doll, was very
young. She had come, you remember, on
Christmas day, at the same time with Buff
and Fluff; and the kittens had never yet been
to a party either.</p>

<p>Matilda, who was Rose’s old doll, had been
to almost as many parties as Rose herself.
But Matilda was not invited to this party.
Only the youngest and prettiest dolls were
invited to this party, for it was to be a May-Party,
where every one has to look as beautiful
as possible. Poor Matilda had only one eye
and a broken nose.</p>

<p>Ernestine, who was Lilian’s doll and who
lived in the next block to Rose and Alice, sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
out the invitations to ten dolls and their little
mammas. They were to come at two o’clock
in the afternoon of May Day for a picnic at
her house. And every one was to bring a luncheon
in a little basket, just as if it were a
really truly picnic in the summer woods, instead
of a cold city May.</p>

<p>Rose dressed Alice in her prettiest white
muslin gown, with a blue sash and the dear
little watch which had come in the Christmas
stocking. Alice’s yellow hair was curled and
tied with a blue bow, and she looked so much
like her little mother that Mrs. Thornton
could not help laughing when they started for
the picnic together. But Rose did not see
anything very funny about it. Every one said
that she looked like her own mother, and why
should not Alice look like Rose?</p>

<p>At the very last moment, when they were
starting for the party, Rose ran back upstairs
to the play-room, where the old Matilda sat
in her little chair by the fireplace.</p>

<p>“You poor dear old thing,” said Rose, hugging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
her tight, “I never before went to a
party without you, and it seems very cruel to
leave you all alone. But please remember that
I still love you dearly, though you have only
one eye, and your nose is broken, and you
aren’t pretty like Alice. I can’t take you to
parties any more, because people would laugh
at you. But you have had a great many good
times, haven’t you, Matilda? while Alice
hasn’t been yet to a single party. I must
make Alice have a good time now, for she is
my youngest child. Good-by, Matilda dear,
and don’t you be lonesome while we are
gone.”</p>

<p>Then Rose kissed the poor old doll and set
her back in the little chair beside the fireplace.
But Matilda looked very sad when the little
mother went out of the door with the new
doll in her arms, and it almost looked as if
there was a real tear on her faded cheek under
the one remaining eye.</p>

<p>When the front door banged behind them,
Matilda fell forward onto the carpet and lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
there face downwards all the while that Rose
and Alice were at the May-Party.</p>

<p>The party was held in Lilian’s dining-room.
The floor was covered with a green
rug which had flowers on it, and which looked
like the real grassy out-doors of the country.
In the middle of the room, instead of a
dining-table, was a little May-pole, as tall as
Rose’s head, with a wreath of flowers at the
top and pretty colored ribbons hanging down
all around it.</p>

<p>On one side was a throne with three little
steps leading up to it, for the May Queen to
sit on. And on top of the throne lay a beautiful
crown of real flowers for the Queen to
wear.</p>

<p>First of all, the dolls were stood up in a
long row, so that the prettiest one might be
chosen. There was Ernestine herself, the
hostess, who was a fat wax doll as big as a
real baby, with flaxen hair and four white
teeth. Ernestine was very accomplished, for
she could say “Papa” and “Mamma,” but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
she was not nice and huggable and pretty like
Alice. (At least, that was what Rose
thought.)</p>

<p>Then there was Marjorie, who had black
hair, and Helen-Grace-Antoinette, who wore
a real satin dress that came from Paris; and
Bébé, who was in long clothes and who was
thought by all the little mothers, except her
own, too babyish for a May-Party. There
was Yo-San, who was a lovely Japanese
lady; and Toto, a little boy sailor doll, the
only gentleman present,—and of course <i>he</i>
couldn’t be the May Queen! Then there were
Blanche, and Beatrice, and Dinah who was
black,—everybody wondered why she came
to the party. Last of all, there was Alice. She
was smaller than Blanche and Beatrice, but
she wore a watch tucked into her sash. No
other doll had a watch.</p>

<p>Each little girl wrote on a piece of paper
the name of the doll which, next to her own,
she thought prettiest. No one could vote for
her own doll, for of course each little mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
would think her own child the best, and
there would have to be ten queens.</p>

<p>Lilian’s mamma counted the votes. And
what do you suppose? Alice was elected to
be May Queen! It was all on account of the
watch. You can imagine how proud Rose
was.</p>

<p>They set Alice on the throne and put the
crown of real flowers on her yellow curls, and
she looked so pretty that Rose had to rush up
and kiss her the very first thing. And all the
other little girls wanted to kiss her, too.</p>

<p>Then the dolls danced around the May-pole,
each one holding the end of one of the
colored ribbons, till the pole was twisted all
the way down and looked like a big stick
of striped candy. The dolls seemed to enjoy
it very much, but their mammas were a bit
dizzy afterwards.</p>

<p>Then it was time for the picnic. Everybody
sat down cross-legged on the green
grass rug and opened the little lunch-baskets.
First they spread a napkin on the grass, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
as one does at a real picnic, and set all the
cakes and cookies and sandwiches on it,
where every one could reach for herself. And
they ate without any plates or knives or forks,
which was great fun. But there were no ants
to come and eat up the crumbs.</p>

<p>There were little cunning cakes, and figs
and dates, grapes and apples, and some molasses
candy. And there was lemonade to
drink,—just like a grown-up picnic.</p>

<p>After they had eaten everything they played
games around the May-pole until it was almost
dark, and then it was time to go home.
But before they went Ernestine, who gave the
party, carried up to the throne a big tissue-paper
basket full of flowers, and gave it to the
May Queen, kneeling down before Alice on
the lowest step of the throne, just as they do
in plays. And Rose was so proud that her
face turned as pink as one of the roses in the
May Queen’s lovely basket. Each doll had a
dear little nosegay to take home, but only the
Queen had a whole basket full of flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“You dear, lovely Queen Alice!” cried
Rose, as she hugged her dollie tight on the
way home. “I am so proud of you, and I
love you better than anything in the world
except Papa and Mamma and Kenneth and
Cousin Charlie,—oh, yes, and Matilda. I
had almost forgotten poor Matilda.”</p>

<p>Rose was quiet for a minute, and then she
whispered to Alice, “Don’t you think you
ought to give some of these lovely flowers to
poor Matilda, who didn’t go to the party and
who isn’t pretty any more?”</p>

<p>Alice was a sweet little doll, and was quite
willing to share her flowers. So as soon as the
front door was opened Rose ran upstairs to
the play-room with the May Queen on one
arm and the basket of flowers on the other.
There she found poor Matilda lying face
downward on the carpet.</p>

<p class="caption">SHE LIFTED POOR MATILDA AND SET HER UP ON THE

</figure>

<p>“Oh, you poor, poor dollie!” cried Rose.
“Did you feel so badly as that? Well, don’t
cry any more. Here is your dear little sister,
the May Queen, who has come to share her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
lovely flowers with you. We both love you
so much that we are going to make you our
Play-Room Queen. See!”</p>

<p>Then she lifted poor Matilda and set her
up on the window seat, as if she were on a
throne. And she took the beautiful flowers
out of Alice’s basket and made a wreath
which she placed on the old doll’s scraggly
hair. And she pinned a lovely rose on Matilda’s
dress.</p>

<p>“Now you look very nice and dear,” said
Rose, as she kissed her on her battered cheek.
“Good-night, Queen Matilda of the play-room.
Isn’t this almost as good as being May
Queen?”</p>

<p>And Matilda looked as if she thought it
was. She seemed to be smiling with her ugly
mouth. And when Rose softly shut the door
of the play-room the old doll looked almost
pretty,—in spite of her one eye and broken
nose,—sitting there on the window seat, with
Alice, the beautiful May Queen, at her feet.</p>

<small>THE DARK ROOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the middle of June Kenneth came down
with the scarlet fever. This was very
unpleasant for Kenneth, and for Kenneth’s
papa and mamma, who were just making
ready to move the family down to the Island
for the summer. It was very hard for Rose,
too; for of course she could not play with
Kenneth nor even see him for fear lest she
too should catch the fever. It was a terrible
thing for Rose not to see Kenneth for days
and weeks.</p>

<p>They decided to send her away into the
country, to the farm where Aunt Mary and
Uncle John with Rose’s cousin Charlie Carroll
had gone to live. Aunt Mary said that she
would be glad to play for a while that Rose
was her own little girl, for poor Aunt Mary
had no little girl of her own. And Charlie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
thought that it would be great fun to have a
little sister; for you see he had never had one.
And that is why he did not make a very
good kind of brother at first.</p>

<p>Rose had not been in the country long before
she began to miss Kenneth more than
ever,—more even than she had expected. It
was all Charlie’s fault.</p>

<p>Charlie had his naughty days,—every one
has naughty days, sometimes, until he learns
better. But it happened unfortunately that
Charlie’s naughtiest time came the very day
after Rose arrived in the country, when she
was feeling especially lonesome, and before
she was acquainted with the new house and
the barn and the new pets and playthings. She
began to be homesick almost as soon as her
father said good-by to her and went away to
the train which would carry him home to
Mamma and Kenneth and the city. But she
was still more homesick the next morning,
when she woke up and remembered that she
was not going to see Kenneth all that long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
bright, beautiful, out-of-doorsy day. So you
see she needed very much that Charlie should
be extra kind and good to her.</p>

<p>Charlie’s mamma lay awake that morning
smiling to herself to think how nice it
was that Rose was going to be Charlie’s little
sister for a time, and how happy he would
make her in this beautiful country, showing
her the new kittens, and the rabbits, and old
Brindle’s little calf, and the flower-garden,—all
the things which Charlie had enjoyed so
much since he had come into the county to
live. But that was before she knew this was
Charlie’s naughty day.</p>

<p>From the moment when he first opened his
eyes and got out of the wrong side of the bed,
Charlie was in trouble, and his mother had to
speak to him so many times that she was
ashamed to have Rose hear.</p>

<p>After breakfast, when Rose cried eagerly,
“Oh, Charlie, now will you show me everything?”
Charlie sulked and said, “Oh,
bother!” And when Rose followed him out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
into the garden, he tried to run away from
her. But Rose could run fast too, and he
soon found her panting at his heels.</p>

<p>“What makes you run so fast, Charlie?” she
asked. “I can hardly keep up with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want you to keep up with
me,” he answered, turning his back on her
and slapping his stick at a poor sunflower.
“You had better go back to the house. I
don’t want to play with you.”</p>

<p>Rose’s eyes filled with tears and she said,
“What makes you so bad to me, Charlie?
I haven’t seen you for a long time, but I
thought you were a nice, pleasant boy, like
Kenneth. Oh, how I wish I could go back
to Kenneth!”</p>

<p>“Go home as soon as you please,” said Charlie
rudely. “I don’t want you for a sister if
you are so fussy and cross.”</p>

<p>“I am not fussy and cross!” cried Rose indignantly.
“You have been very impolite and
horrid to me, and I am ashamed of you!”</p>

<p>Then, I am sorry to say, Charlie did a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
naughty thing. He pushed Rose roughly, so
that she fell down and bruised her poor little
knee. She tried not to cry, but the tears would
come. And when she saw Charlie disappear
around the corner of the house with his hands
in his pockets, as if he did not care at all, she
began to sob.</p>

<p>“I wish I had not come to the country!”
she whimpered.</p>

<p>Now from the parlor window Charlie’s
mother had seen this last naughtiness, and
straightway she went after her boy, who was
kicking his toe against the piazza steps.</p>

<p>“Charlie, you have been a very naughty
boy,” she said. “You have hurt your little
cousin, and I must punish you. What makes
you so bad to-day? I thought you and Rose
would have such pleasant times together!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like girls,” said Charlie sulkily.
“They are telltales and cry-babies. I am
glad I pushed her.”</p>

<p>“Charlie!” exclaimed his mother, much
shocked. “Go right up to the dark room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
and sit down in a chair and stay there until
you are sorry. When you are truly sorry you
can come out and tell Rose.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t ever be sorry,” said Charlie obstinately.
“And I will never tell her that I
am.”</p>

<p>“Then you will have no supper to-night,”
said his mother firmly. “Go, now. Do as I
tell you, Charlie.”</p>

<p>Charlie knew that it was not safe to linger
when his mother spoke in that tone. He
stamped up the three flights of stairs and opened
the door of the dark room. It was a spare
chamber that was seldom used, save on Charlie’s
naughty days. The blinds were closed
tight, and not a ray of the beautiful summer
sunshine could enter. Instead, there was a
gloomy, greenish dimness, which was not at
all pleasant. And the room was very, very still.
The rest of the world seemed a long way off.</p>

<p>Charlie dragged a chair into the middle of
the room and sat down, kicking the rungs with
his feet. It was all Rose’s fault. He had given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
her only a tiny push, and it could not have hurt
her much. She was such a cry-baby and telltale!
Of course it must have been she who had
told his mother all about it. He could hear the
faint sound of old Carlo barking outside, and
fancied he caught echoes of Rose’s happy
laughter. Yes, undoubtedly the mean little
thing was playing with Carlo, enjoying herself
in the beautiful sunshine as if nothing had happened,
while he was shut up in the old dark
room! Charlie thought of all the fine things
he had planned to do this day, if something
had not gone wrong from the very beginning.</p>

<p>A great fly buzzed against the window pane,
and for a time Charlie was interested in watching
it bump its foolish head again and again.
But he soon grew tired of the sight and sound.
What a stupid way to spend a beautiful day,
watching an old fly in a dark room! How the
minutes dragged that usually galloped away
too fast! He had only to say that he was sorry,
and he might come out. But he was not sorry,
and he would never tell Rose so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>The time dragged on. The fly had ceased
to buzz, and Carlo to bark. There was no
sound inside or outside the dark room. Probably
Rose had gone to ride. Mamma had promised
to take them to the lake, where they
could learn to row. What fun that would
have been! Now Rose was enjoying it alone.
Selfish little thing!</p>

<p>Charlie began to fidget. The chair was hard
and uncomfortable; he thought he must have
been sitting there for hours. Luncheon time
was over and gone. It must be almost evening.
Surely it was growing even darker in the
dark room. How could he ever bear to stay
there all night alone—without any supper,
too! He began to feel very hungry indeed.
Suppose he should starve to death! That would
make Rose feel badly enough. He hoped it
would break her heart. A tear rolled down
the side of his nose at the thought of his
sad fate.</p>

<p>Just then he heard a sound outside the door.
The knob turned, and in tiptoed a little figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
in white, with yellow hair and blue ribbons.
It was Rose. Her face was tear-stained, and
she looked piteously at him without speaking.
Charlie frowned, and turned his head away.
He was not sorry.</p>

<p>Rose stood first on one foot and then on the
other, glancing shyly at Charlie, as if hoping
that he would speak. But he only sulked and
kicked the chair-rung harder. At last she
dragged another chair from a corner of the
room, placed its back to his, climbed up into
it and sat down.</p>

<p>“H’m!” thought Charlie, “She has been
naughty too. Now Mamma sees that I am
not the only bad one. I wonder how long
she will have to stay here.”</p>

<p>They sat silent for a long time, back to
back. Then Charlie heard a sniff behind him.
He knew that Rose was crying. “I am glad
of it!” he said to himself. “I am glad she
was naughty and had to be punished. Usually
girls are not punished like boys. They are
lucky, and manage to escape.”</p>

<p class="caption">IN TIPTOED A LITTLE FIGURE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Another little sniff from Rose; then a long
silence. At last she spoke, in a half-sobbing
voice: “It is beautiful out of doors. But it
is horrid in this dark room.” Charlie made
no reply. Presently Rose tried again. “How
long have you got to stay here, Charlie?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he answered gruffly; “all
night, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Rose’s tone was startled, and again
there was a long silence.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to have any supper,
Charlie?” she asked wistfully.</p>

<p>“No,” said Charlie. “Are you?”</p>

<p>“N-no,” said Rose hesitating, and then
she gave a very long sigh.</p>

<p>Charlie chuckled. She had “told” of him.
It was her fault. Since he had to suffer, it was
some comfort to think that she must do so
also. He was not a bit sorry.</p>

<p>“I wish we could have gone to the lake,”
sighed Rose again. “I s’pect Aunt Mary went
without us.” At this tantalizing thought
Charlie retorted angrily:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“If you had not been a cry-baby and a
telltale, mother wouldn’t have punished me,
and we could both have gone.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell!” cried Rose indignantly.
“I wouldn’t have told if you had broken my
leg off. I can’t bear telltales, and I wouldn’t
be one for anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did mother know, then?”
asked Charlie, somewhat less crossly.</p>

<p>“I s’pose she looked out of the window
and saw you push me, and I s’pose she saw
that I was mis’able.”</p>

<p>“Cry-baby!” taunted Charlie scornfully.</p>

<p>“I am not a cry-baby,” said Rose, with a
quaver in her voice. “It took all the skin
off my knee—look!—and it hurts awfully
when I bend it around, <i>so</i>. But I never told
Aunt Mary, and she doesn’t know. I cried
a little because—because you hurt my feelings;
that was why.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Charlie, looking at
the bruised, tender little knee. He tried to
make light of it, but his cheeks reddened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
and he felt ashamed. Rose was such a little
thing, after all.</p>

<p>Rose writhed in her seat. “Must you stay
in the chair all the time?” she asked over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Charlie briefly.</p>

<p>“It is so hard! I thought—if we could
stand up, or sit down on the floor—maybe—but
anyway we might play something else,
some kind of <i>quiet</i> game; Twenty Questions,
or—or something. Would you like to do
that, Charlie?” She twisted about in the
chair and eyed the back of his head wistfully.
Charlie hardened his heart.</p>

<p>“No,” he said crossly. “I don’t want to
play anything in this horrid old dark room.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t quite so lonesome now that I am
here, is it?” asked Rose anxiously. Charlie
made no reply. “I thought you might be glad
for company,” she went on. “I don’t mind
being here—much. But it <i>is</i> nicer outside.
There is Carlo—hear him bark! And there
are the sunshine and the birds and flowers—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
everything. Oh, it is lovely here in the
country! I thought we would have such good
times together, Charlie, as we used to do when
you lived in the city, only here it is much nicer.
You have so many lovely things to show me,
Aunt Mary said. But now”— She stopped
short as if afraid of hurting his feelings.</p>

<p>“How long have you got to stay here?”
asked Charlie, wishing that she would go
away.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” she answered; “perhaps
all night. But I hope not.”</p>

<p>“Why, what did you do that was so bad?”
asked Charlie, turning half around, in surprised
interest.</p>

<p>“I? Oh, I—I—I didn’t do anything,”
stammered Rose.</p>

<p>“Then why did Mamma send you here?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“She didn’t send me. She doesn’t know
I’m here. She thinks that I am in the summer-house
with Carlo and my dolls, where she
left me—hours ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Then what did you come here for?”
Charlie looked at her sternly. She dropped
her eyes and fidgeted with the ruffle of her
dress.</p>

<p>“I—I came because I didn’t want you
to be punished all alone. P’rhaps if I hadn’t
come to your house you would not have
been naughty at all; so it was partly my fault.
I am so sorry, Charlie! I shall stay here as
long as you do.”</p>

<p>Charlie whirled around in his chair and
sat back resolutely. He would <i>not</i> be sorry.
Yes, it had been her fault; she had made him
angry. Let her stay and be unhappy!</p>

<p>They sat very still for a time, then Charlie
felt a little hand steal around the chair-back
and touch his gently. But he jerked away.</p>

<p>“Are you angry, Charlie, because I came?”
asked the soft little voice. “If you are very
angry, I will go away. But I had much rather
stay here in the dark with you. I—I am so
lonesome without Kenneth, and you are all the
brother I have now. Won’t you let me be your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
little truly sister and do as I would if you were
Kenneth? When I knew you were shut up
here it made me so unhappy that I couldn’t
play. I couldn’t even enjoy the sunshine and
the flowers. If you go without your supper, so
shall I. And if you stay here all night, I—I
<i>think</i> I shall not be afraid to stay with you.
But I hope Auntie will let you out before
then.”</p>

<p>“No, she will not,” said Charlie, positively.
“I know she will not.”</p>

<p>“Not if I ask her? Not if I tell her that it
makes me very sad to have you here?” Rose’s
voice trembled.</p>

<p>“No,” said Charlie, “I don’t think I shall
<i>ever</i> come out.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Rose in horror. “Then we
shall die here together. We shall starve to
death like the Babes in the Woods; but there
will be no Robin Redbreasts to cover us with
leaves. Oh, Charlie! Surely Aunt Mary would
not be so cruel.”</p>

<p>Charlie could not bear to have any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
think so of his kind mother. “Mamma is
not cruel,” he said. “If I stay here it is my
own choice. I could come out now, if I chose
to—to say—something.”</p>

<p>Rose clapped her hands. “Oh, say it, say it
now, Charlie!” she cried.</p>

<p>At that moment a bell rang invitingly from
downstairs. “Do say it, Charlie,” she begged.
“There is the supper bell, and I am so hungry,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Charlie was very hungry, but he bit his lip
and answered, “No, I will not say it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why not?” begged Rose. “What
is it that you must say? Is it so very hard?”</p>

<p>“Well,—I must say that I am sorry because
I pushed you.” Charlie blurted out the
words with a gulp of shame.</p>

<p>“Oh, Charlie! And you are not sorry?”
Rose pleaded.</p>

<p>“No, I am not sorry.”</p>

<p>“Not a little bit?”</p>

<p>“No, not one bit.”</p>

<p>Rose gave a little sigh and sank back in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
chair. “Well, then I s’pose we must stay here
and be hungry. For of course you mustn’t
say it unless you are really and truly sorry—not
even for the sake of supper. But oh! I
know there is going to be jelly-roll. I saw
Maggie making it this morning.”</p>

<p>Charlie kicked the chair hard. “Let’s try
to think about something else,” went on
Rose cheerfully; “then perhaps we shall forget
to be hungry. Let’s talk about—about
Carlo.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do keep still!” grumbled Charlie. “I
don’t want to talk at all.” Rose was silent for
some minutes. Then she began to speak again,
half to herself.</p>

<p>“I think I will go home to-morrow, if I
don’t starve before that. I will go to Kenneth,
who will be so glad to see me, even if he is
sick. Maybe I shall catch the fever and die.
But that would be better than living where I
have no little brother to love me. After I am
gone, Charlie can come out, for of course
Auntie will not ask him to tell me he is sorry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
if I am not here to listen. Then Carlo and
the rabbits and Brindle and the calf will all
be glad to see Charlie again, and no one will
miss me, for I am only a silly little girl who
spoils the beautiful country so that no one is
happy here any more.” Here Rose gave a
great sob. Charlie wriggled uncomfortably
in his chair.</p>

<p>“I say, Rose, don’t talk like that. I don’t
want you to go home. It wasn’t your fault.
I was very bad to you,” he stammered.</p>

<p>“But it was my fault, too,” cried Rose
eagerly. “I ought not to have said you were
impolite and horrid. Even when you pushed
me—”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I did that, Rose,” interrupted
Charlie quickly. “I am, truly. I didn’t
mean to hurt you.”</p>

<p>Once more the little hand stole around the
chair-back and crept into his own. Charlie
did not drop it this time. “You said it!”
cried Rose. “Oh, Charlie! I am so glad!
Now we can go down to supper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Charlie stared. “Said it? What do you
mean? What have I said?”</p>

<p>“Why, you said <i>It</i>; that you were sorry,”
cried Rose, clapping her hands. “So it is all
right now.”</p>

<p>Charlie looked rather silly. “I—I didn’t
mean to say it,” he faltered. “I said I would
never say it, and I meant what I said. But I
<i>am</i> sorry, and now I am glad I said I was.”
This sounded very queer, but Rose knew what
he meant, and was quite satisfied.</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and
Charlie’s mamma appeared, looking anxious.</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are, Rose, my child,” she
said. “Who would have thought to find
you here! I was so worried. We have been
looking for you all over the place. Have
you been here all this beautiful afternoon,
you poor little thing?” She looked reproachfully
at Charlie.</p>

<p>“I wanted to stay here,” said Rose cheerfully.
“But I am glad it is time to come
out now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Come, then, Dearie; you must be very
hungry,” said Charlie’s mother, taking Rose’s
hand and leading her towards the door. But
Rose hung back.</p>

<p>“You come too, Charlie,” she smiled.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Charlie bravely, “I am
sorry I was naughty to Rose. I have just told
her so. She is a <i>brick</i>, and I wish she was
going to be my truly sister always. For the
rest of her visit I am going to make her have
the best time she ever knew.”</p>

<p>Then the supper bell rang again, anxiously,
and the two children took hold of hands,
scampering down the stairs like hungry puppies
when they hear their master’s whistle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE GARDEN OF LIVE FLOWERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER Kenneth recovered from the
scarlet fever and Rose came back to
the city, the Thornton family went away
for the summer to their island down in Maine,
which the children loved better than any other
place in the whole world.</p>

<p>It was a very wonderful island, and though
Kenneth and Rose had gone down there as
many years as they could remember, they were
continually finding something new which they
had never seen before. They liked to play
that it was a desert island and that they were
Robinson Crusoes who were exploring to see
what they might find. And they were always
hoping to come upon a mysterious footprint,
or something like that.</p>

<p>One particular day they were scrambling
about on the rocks, a long way from the foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
of the cliff on which perched their summer
home. They had never before happened to
climb down to this particular spot, because it
was such a steep scramble. From the top of
the cliff it did not look interesting at all. I
dare say nobody had ever before been on that
part of the island, except perhaps the Prout
children, who lived not far away all the year
round. It was a bad landing-place; no boat
could ever come in from the sea on account
of the big waves that dashed up on the sharp
rocks. And nobody would ever have thought
of scrambling down the cliff and over those
rough boulders unless, like Columbus, he was
an adventurous explorer looking to see what
he might find. But you see, that is just what
Kenneth and Rose were. They were explorers,
and they had their eyes wide open to see what
there might be in this new place.</p>

<p>They hopped over the little rocks and
climbed over the big ones; they crawled over
some and slid down others which were very
slippery. For the tide had gone out, and here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and there the rocks held little pools which
the sun had not dried.</p>

<p>There were shells and seaweed and starfish
in these pools, but the children did not stop
to gather them, for they had seen others just
like them often before. They scrambled on
towards a big, big rock that stood up right
across the way between the cliff and the
foamy water.</p>

<p>“We can’t go any further,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“Oh, we must go further,” answered Kenneth.
“Perhaps there is some big discovery
just beyond. Why, Rose, supposing Columbus
had stopped the first time he was discouraged,
he would never have discovered America.
And then where should we be now?”</p>

<p>Rose could not answer that question. So
they decided to go on. Kenneth helped Rose
and Rose helped Kenneth, and they scrambled
and climbed and puffed and panted, and
bumped their knees on the rock, which was
the hardest one that they had ever climbed.
But at last they came to the top; and beyond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
down below, was a flat rock which the tide had
just washed clean as a spandy floor.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Kenneth. “I don’t think
<i>that</i> is very much to find. I hoped there would
be at least a cave.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go down,” said Rose. “I think it
looks nice. See, there is a shelf over the edge.
Perhaps there is a cave or something under
this big rock. I want to go down and see.”</p>

<p>So they began to slide and scramble again;
and it is a great deal easier to slide down than
up, as every one knows. In a very few moments
Kenneth landed on all fours on the flat
shelf of rock, and in another minute Rose
bumped down beside him. And then Rose said
“Oh!”</p>

<p>Now perhaps you think that she said “Oh!”
because she had bumped her little nose on the
hard rock. But that was not the reason. Rose
scarcely ever cried, even when she bumped
herself hard, for she was a brave little girl, the
nicest kind of a sister for a boy to have.</p>

<p>No; Rose said “Oh!” because she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
made a discovery. There was something under
the shelf of rock down which they had slid.
There was a pool of water; a long, shallow pool
of sea-water as cold as ice, into which Rose
had plunged her foot. But that was not all.
It was a tiny, beautiful sea-garden full of
flowers.</p>

<p>Kenneth cried “Oh!” too, when he saw
where Rose was pointing, and in a minute
the two children were lying flat on their stomachs
staring at the wonderful garden. My!
But I wish you could have seen how wonderful
it was. I must try to tell you how it looked.</p>

<p>In the first place, the bottom of the basin,
the rocky pool in which some of the sea-water
had been glad to linger when the rest ran away
with the tide,—this bowl was of a brilliant
pink, bright as Rose’s own pink cheeks. It
was covered with a thick painted coating like
coral, and I suppose some kind of little animal
like a coral-creature had made it so. In
the next place, up from the pinkness grew tiny
plants of seaweed, green and brown and yellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
branching and spreading out like little
trees and bushes, and waving in the water just
as trees do in the wind. Among the seaweed
lived pink and purple and yellow starfish and
little crawling periwinkles carrying their shell
houses upon their backs. Here and there a
funny little hermit-crab scuttled busily about,
keeping tightly hold of the shell which he
had stolen to be his home. Among the leaves
of the seaweed trees Rose spied a tiny conger
eel moving to and fro, waving his fins as though
they were wings, this queer ocean bird!</p>

<p>But what made Kenneth and Rose cry “Oh,
oh, oh!” three times out loud and clap their
hands with joy, was the living flowers.</p>

<p>Living flowers! You have read in fairy-books
about flowers that came alive? But this
is no fairy-story, and these flowers were real,
truly live flowers,—flowers that were happy
and hungry, that ate and drank and moved,
opening and closing whenever they chose.</p>

<p>Some of the flowers were brown,—little
brown sacks, with a daisy flower growing out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the end, waving its petals to and fro to catch its
dinner of tiny unseen things that live in the
water. Some of the flowers were green, some
were yellowish pink, some pale greenish blue.
And they were all wide open under the water,
staring up through it at the blue sky.</p>

<p>One flower was like a little ripe, red strawberry,
growing from the roof of the cave; just
the size and shape of a juicy strawberry, and
looking good enough to eat. Each blue flower-star
had a white centre, and when Rose put her
little finger down very carefully into this mouth,
it closed its petals tightly, for it thought it had
found a nice bit of dinner. It was a funny,
tickly feeling, and Rose drew away her finger
quickly, but very gently so as not to hurt the
sea-flower. Then Kenneth put his finger into
the mouth of one of the pinkish flowers, and
the petals did not move. He tickled the
flower gently, and it seemed to like the feeling,
which I dare say was as new to the flower as
the flower was to Kenneth. For the children
had never before seen a garden of live flowers.</p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">LIVING FLOWERS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>For a long time they lay and watched the
wonderful little pool and the beautiful flowers,
that moved their petals so gracefully in the
water. And they never noticed that a storm
was gathering out to sea. But by and by they
saw that the flowers were closing one by one,
closing tightly and not opening again.</p>

<p>“Why, what makes the flowers go to
sleep?” cried Rose sorrowfully. “It is not
night yet, and garden flowers do not close till
the sun sets.”</p>

<p>“It is growing dark,” said Kenneth.
“There is a cloud coming over the sun.”</p>

<p>Sure enough! A heavy cloud rolled over
the sun, and all the sea-flowers closed their
eyes tightly, just as earth-flowers do at night.
Then Kenneth and Rose sat up and looked
around. My! They were surprised! A heavy
fog was rolling in from sea, and it was going
to rain very soon. They had been so interested
in the flowers that they had not thought
of this.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is going to rain!” cried Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“The flowers have warned us just in time.
Let us hurry home, Kenneth, before the fog
shuts down so that we cannot see the way.”
For they knew how cruel the fogs were about
the island, so thick and heavy that the fishermen
themselves were afraid of being caught
in them, and of losing the way home.</p>

<p>The children jumped up and said good-by
to the beautiful garden. Then they climbed,
slid, hopped, and scrambled back over the
rocks towards home, racing with the storm.
And they reached the house just as the first
drops of rain began to fall. They rushed up
onto the piazza, where their mamma was
looking anxiously for them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma,” they cried both together,
“we have seen a garden of live flowers.”</p>

<p>“Pink and blue and red!” cried Rose.</p>

<p>“And they closed tight so as to let us
know that the storm was coming,” said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“What, you have found a pool of sea-anemones?”
cried their mother, delighted. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
am so glad! I did not know there were any
on this island.”</p>

<p>“And will you come with us to-morrow
to see them?” begged Rose. “We will show
you, but it is going to be a great secret. Sh!
Don’t let any one hear!”</p>

<p>“I am not a good climber,” said their
mother, shaking her head. “I am afraid I
cannot get down that steep cliff. But you
must take your Aunt Claire, who is coming
to-morrow. She will love to go with you, I
know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is Aunt Claire coming to-morrow?
Hurray!” cried Kenneth. For the children
thought that their Aunt Claire was great fun.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! We will take Aunt Claire to see
the flowers,” said Rose. “But we mustn’t
tell any one else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you must keep the discovery a great
secret,” said their mamma. “Some one might
want to transplant the little flowers, and that
would be a great pity. You must let them
live there in their own sea-garden just as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
are. But what clever little explorers you were
to find them!”</p>

<p>And, indeed, it is not every one who can
discover a garden of live flowers outside a
fairy-book. But this was nicer than any fairy-book,
as their Aunt Claire said when Kenneth
and Rose showed it to her the very next day
after she came to the island. And she ought
to know, for she writes fairy-books and tells
stories better than any one else, so the children
think.</p>

<small>BURIED TREASURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Kenneth and his father went
out fishing with Captain Prout. Rose
and Aunt Claire did not care to go, because
they did not enjoy fishing. But instead they
decided to spend the morning on the sandy
beach, not far from the cottage, which was
a grand play-room and bathing-place for the
children. It was the only sandy beach on
that rocky island.</p>

<p>Rose ran ahead of her Aunt Claire, and as
soon as she reached the beach she sat down to
pull off her shoes and stockings. For in this
lovely play-room she never wore shoes, nor
even sandals, but ran around with bare toes on
the smooth, soft floor, making funny little
tracks just as the sandpipers do. But of course
Rose’s footprints were larger than their three-toed
ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>When they reached the beach they saw
that the tide was very low, and that the sand
stretched out like a great sheet of paper,
smooth and white, without a mark upon it,
from the seaweed line to the water. For it
was early in the morning, and they were the
very first persons on the spot. Yesterday they
had made houses of sand and had dug deep
wells all up and down the beach. But in the
night the sea had stolen up and swept everything
smooth again, even wiping out the
tracks of feet which had crossed and criss-crossed
it everywhere,—Aunt Claire’s tennis
shoes, Kenneth’s and Rose’s little bare footprints,
the deep tread of the clam-digger’s
rubber boots, and the sandpipers’ light steps.
The beach looked like a field covered with
newly fallen snow on which nothing has yet
made a mark.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Claire, who was always having
splendid ideas, thought of a lovely game to
play upon this smooth whiteness.</p>

<p class="caption">THE SAND STRETCHED OUT LIKE A GREAT SHEET OF PAPER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Oh, Rose,” she cried, “let us play a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
kind of hide-and-seek. I will shut my eyes,
and you take this pretty whirly-shell which
we found yesterday and hide it somewhere in
the sand. Then I will try to find it by following
the track of your bare feet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodie!” said Rose, clapping her
hands. “That is a nice game. Play I am a
pirate going to hide my treasure in the ground,
and you are another pirate hunting for it.
Blind your eyes, Auntie. Blind them tight,
and don’t you peek!”</p>

<p>Aunt Claire blinded her eyes and waited
until she heard Rose call, “Coo!” like a
pirate. Then she looked up, and Rose was
standing in the deep, soft sand not very far
away. But Aunt Claire knew that she had
not hidden the treasure so near. Oh, no!
Rose was too sly a pirate to do that.</p>

<p>Aunt Claire peered all around very carefully,
and finally she spied the marks of little bare
toes in the sand near the spot where Rose had
stood when they first began to play. And she
followed the tracks down to the water and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
up again, winding about in the funniest way,—something
like this:—</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i130">
<img class="w100" src="images/i130.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Up and down and round about, twisting
in and out, went the funny little marks, till
Aunt Claire’s head whirled dizzily. Rose
clapped her hands and laughed to see her
trying to set her tennis shoes exactly in the
track of those crazy wanderings. But at last,
close by the water’s edge, Aunt Claire saw a
little something which rose up like a bump
on the sand; and about it were the marks
of finger-scrapings. She stooped down and
dug with her fingers, and soon she cried: “I
spy!” and held up the pretty shell which
Rose had hidden. “The treasure is found!”
said Aunt Claire. “But what a search you
made for me, wicked Pirate!”</p>

<p>“It is a lovely game,” said Rose, hopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
up and down with excitement. “Now <i>you</i>
hide, Aunt Claire,” Rose put her hands over
her eyes, and her auntie came back to the
soft sand in order to start fair on a smooth
piece of beach. Pretty soon she cried, “Coo!”
And the marks of her shoes looked something
like this:—</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i131">
<img class="w100" src="images/i131.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Oh, I never, never can find the treasure
in all that whirly-whirly!” cried Rose, shaking
her curls like a Skye terrier. And indeed,
it looked very hard. But Rose walked
right along in the big prints of her auntie’s
shoes, and without much trouble she found
the shell where it was hidden in the middle
of the whirly-figure.</p>

<p>“That was a good hide,” she said.</p>

<p>They played the pirate game for a long time,
until the sand was covered up and down with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the strangest patterns, and there was hardly
room for a fresh footprint anywhere; for this
was not a large beach.</p>

<p>“We shall have to stop, now, I suppose,”
said Rose with a sigh, “and wait until Mr.
Sea has washed out all our marks with his
ocean sponge. See, he is creeping up and has
begun already. To-morrow the beach will be
all smooth and white again so that we can
show Kenneth how to play buried treasure,
too.”</p>

<p>“Let us play just once more,” said Aunt
Claire. “It is my turn to hide the treasure,
and I think I can find a place which will not
be too hard, all among these markings. Blind
your eyes, little Pirate.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Rose, who was a very
good-natured pirate. And she closed her
eyes.</p>

<p>Now there was not much smooth sand for
Aunt Claire to walk in, but she managed to
go up and down the beach in a funny parallel-lined
pattern, like this:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i133">
<img class="w100" src="images/i133.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>And when she called, “Coo,” Rose started off
upon the trail, laughing every time she turned
the sharp corner and came back upon the long
stretch up or down.</p>

<p>At last she came to the little bubbly mound
in the sand where Aunt Claire had hidden the
treasure. She stooped over and her yellow
curls swept the sand as she thrust in all her ten
fingers with a shout of triumph. Presently she
jumped up with the treasure in her hand and
stood still, examining it curiously. Then she
gave a squeal of joy and came racing up the
beach to her auntie, with her curls flying
madly.</p>

<p>“Why, Aunt Claire,” she cried, “it is a
really, truly treasure, this time! See what was
hidden inside the whirly-shell!” and she held
up a bright ten-cent piece which she had
pulled out of the little treasure-box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“So there is,” said her auntie. “I wonder
how it got there?”</p>

<p>Rose looked at Aunt Claire and laughed.
“I like this game; very specially the end of
it,” she said. “Now what shall we do next,
Auntie?”</p>

<p>“We can’t play here any more,” said Aunt
Claire. “The beach is so marked up that if
a pirate should hide his treasure here he might
never be able to find it again. I would not
risk mine, if I were you.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose I had better not,” said Rose,
shaking her head. “I think I ought to keep
the money for the game to-morrow, shouldn’t
I, Auntie?” she added, rather wistfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said Aunt Claire. “A pirate
would never do that. You must go up to the
store and change it for merchandise. That is
what pirates always did in the old days.”</p>

<p>“What is merchandise?” asked Rose
brightening. Then with a sudden thought,
“Is candy merchandise?” And Aunt Claire
said that it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Well, then, you must come with me to
the store and share,” said Rose, pulling her
auntie by the hand. And away both pirates
went to the little village store which was about
a mile from the cottage.</p>

<p>“I think it is lovely to be a pirate!” cried
Rose, as she danced along the road with the
ten-cent piece in her hand. “I am going to
be a pirate every single day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not every day,” said her auntie, in
dismay. “The pirates did not go pirating
every day, or there would not have been treasure
enough to last. They did other things
between whiles.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they couldn’t go pirating when
it rained,” said Rose thoughtfully. “Perhaps
it may rain to-morrow.”</p>

<p>And it did.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE PIECED BABY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR a long time Rose had been wanting a
little sister. Kenneth was the very best
brother that ever lived, and they had beautiful
times playing together. But Kenneth was
growing to be a big boy, and he liked a great
many things that Rose did not enjoy,—fishing,
for instance, which made her very ill.
And there were things which Rose liked that
Kenneth would not play with her. Rose
thought if only she had a little sister they two
would like just the same sort of things. They
could play dolls together, and house, and tea-party,
and have the most beautiful times when
Kenneth was away doing something very
different.</p>

<p>Rose had waited a long time for the little
sister. She had spoken to her papa and mamma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
about it months before, and they had said that
perhaps some time there would come a little
sister for her. Rose thought that Christmas
would be a very nice time for the sister to
come. But although Santa Claus was very kind
and had brought two little kittens to Christine,
the Christmas cat, and had brought Alice,
her beautiful new doll, to Rose herself, there
had been no baby sister in mamma’s stocking
nor in papa’s.</p>

<p>Rose was almost tired of waiting. She
wanted the little sister so much that one morning,
when Kenneth had gone to dig clams with
Captain Prout, she cried all by herself out in
the woods behind the house,—cried as if her
heart would break. Her Aunt Claire found
her there, and asked her what was the matter.
Then Rose told her all about it.</p>

<p>“Have you asked the fairies to help you?”
said Aunt Claire sympathetically. Rose said
that she had forgotten to do that.</p>

<p>“Well, I would do so, if I were you,” said
Aunt Claire gravely. “One never knows what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
may happen if you can only get the fairies to
help.”</p>

<p>Rose thought over what her auntie had said
all that day, and she resolved to ask the fairies
to help her at the very first chance she had.
She sometimes saw them, when she woke up
between dreams at night, and she hoped that
very soon she should meet her friends again.
It happened sooner than she expected.</p>

<p>That very night, when she had not been
asleep very long, she was suddenly awakened
by a little silvery laugh. And when she
opened her eyes to see what had laughed,
there in the moonlight at the foot of her
bed stood a beautiful Fairy in a silver dress.</p>

<p>“Why, Rose, what are you crying about?”
said the Fairy.</p>

<p>“Was I crying?” said Rose. “I did not
know it.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i139">
<img class="w100" src="images/i139.jpg" alt="AWAKENED BY A LITTLE SILVERY LAUGH">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">AWAKENED BY A LITTLE SILVERY LAUGH</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Yes,” said the Fairy. “You were crying
in your sleep, sobbing so hard that I heard
you away off in Fairyland. So I knew something
very sad must be troubling you, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
came just as quickly as I could to my little
friend. What is it, Rose? What is the matter?”</p>

<p>The Fairy spoke so kindly that Rose began
to cry again.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do so want a little sister!” she
sobbed.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you go about to get
one?” asked the Fairy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how,” said Rose, blinking
the tears in wonder. “Where can I find one,
dear Fairy?”</p>

<p>“You can’t find a whole baby,” said the
Fairy, “but you must gather her in little pieces.
Then perhaps my fairies will put her together
for you, like a patchwork quilt.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of such a thing!” exclaimed
Rose indignantly. “I don’t want a pieced
little sister, I want a nice whole one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” returned the Fairy Queen
carelessly, “but I’ll tell you a secret. They
are <i>all</i> pieced that way, though nobody knows
it. The seams never show, we take such fine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
fine stitches. But the pieces must be carefully
chosen. Haven’t you noticed how some
babies have a nose which doesn’t belong with
the chin, or unmatched eyes, or ears which
are not a truly pair? You must do better than
that, Rose. You must choose carefully, so that
your little sister will be symmetrical and even,—the
same on both sides.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can I really do it?” cried Rose eagerly,
sitting up in bed. “When may I begin?”</p>

<p>“Begin now,” said the Fairy. “I suppose
you would like to have the little sister as soon
as possible?”</p>

<p>“I would like her to-morrow!” cried
Rose, jumping out of bed. “But how shall
I begin? Will you not help me?”</p>

<p>“I cannot help you to collect the pieces,”
answered the Fairy, “but I will give you a
hint. You might begin with a <i>face</i> for your
little sister; and why not go to the clock for
that?” So saying the Fairy suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>“Go to the clock!” Rose gasped, “how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
very strange!” Then she looked up at the
tall old clock that faced her bed, and in the
moonlight the face seemed to be smiling at
her. “It’s a queer face for a baby sister to
have,” thought Rose, “but the Fairy ought
to know. I will begin as she told me.” So
she peeled the pillowcase from her pillow to
make a good big bag for the pieces which
she was to collect. Then she went up to the
clock and said politely,—for he was an old
friend of hers,—“Please, Clock, I want your
face to begin a baby sister.” Then she took
off the face and put it in the bottom of the
pillowcase bag.</p>

<p>“Now what must my little sister have
next?” wondered Rose. “<i>Eyes</i>, of course!
But where shall I find eyes?” Just then her
own eyes happened to spy the pincushion on
the bureau. “To be sure! Needles have eyes.
I will borrow two for my sister.” And into
the bundle went two needles. But Rose was
careful that they should be just alike, as the
Fairy had warned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Now I want a <i>nose</i>,” thought Rose. “What
has a nose? Oh—a kettle.” And very quietly,
so as not to waken any one in the house, she
ran down into the kitchen, took the nose
from the teakettle, and put that in the bag.</p>

<p>“A <i>mouth</i>; I must have a mouth next. Oh,
yes, a bottle has a mouth,” said Rose. She
found one in the pantry, and its round mouth
went into the bundle with the eyes and nose.
But there must be a <i>tongue</i> to go in the mouth.
Rose thought and thought; but at last she
remembered that there was a tongue in her
shoe, and that was added to the collection.</p>

<p>“What about a <i>head</i>? She needs that for
her face, her eyes and nose and mouth; I forgot
her head!” cried Rose. “Let me think.
Why, yes, a head of lettuce,—that is what
I want.” And because it was summer, warm
and pleasant out of doors, Rose skipped right
out in her nightie and bare feet. The vegetable
garden was behind the house, and there
Rose picked out a round head of lettuce,
which she added to her funny bundle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>The garden made her think of something
else. The baby must have <i>ears</i>, and where
should one look for ears if not in the cornfield?
So away she tripped to the cornfield,
where for weeks she had been watching the
ears of corn grow plumper every day. Here
she carefully selected two pretty ears, just
alike.</p>

<p>“And now the little sister is ready and
trimmed as far as her neck,” thought Rose.
“And for a <i>neck</i>, I know where I can find
that. Mamma’s white vase on the parlor
mantel has a beautiful neck.” So back to
the house went Rose, and soon into the bundle
with the other things went the white
vase.</p>

<p>“Now let me see, baby must have a <i>body</i>.
What is there that has a body? The body of
a—the body of a—what have I heard? The
body of a wagon; yes, that is it! But I can’t
take Papa’s big wagon. A little one will be
nicer for a baby. I will take the body of Kenneth’s
express wagon,” and Rose pattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
softly to Kenneth’s room, where the little red
cart went into the fast-growing bundle.</p>

<p>Next Rose took the <i>arms</i> of a sofa, two <i>legs</i>
of a chair, and two <i>feet</i> of a table. Then she
went back to her own little room. “You poor
old clock,” she said to her now faceless friend,
“I must rob you again. Please, I want your two
<i>hands</i> for my little sister.” And the clock had
to give her his hands, whether he could spare
them or not. Then Rose remembered that
the baby must have <i>nails</i> on her hands and feet.
So she tiptoed very softly into Mamma’s room
and got twenty nails from the little carpenter’s
chest which Mamma kept in her closet.</p>

<p>By this time the pillowcase had grown very
heavy and hard to carry, like Santa Claus’s
wonderful pack. Moreover, Rose was tired,
for she had been roaming around for a long
time collecting the pieces of her little sister.</p>

<p>“I think I must have everything now,” she
sighed, sitting down on the edge of her bed.
“Such a funny bundle! I hope little Sister
will not look very queer with all these strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
kinds of features and things. I wish the Queen
of the Fairies would come and tell me what
to do next.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment Rose blinked and
stopped talking, for in at the window on a ray
of moonlight came walking the Fairy Queen
herself. She smiled at Rose and nodded when
she saw the big bundle.</p>

<p>“Good!” she said. “You have done well.
I hope that you haven’t forgotten anything,
for that would be awkward.” Rose shook her
head positively. “Very well,” went on the
Fairy, “now empty out your bundle upon the
floor at the foot of the bed, put the pillowcase
on the pillow and go to sleep. As soon
as your eyes are closed tight I will see what
my fairies can do with the pieces which you
have collected. But mind, you must not
peep.”</p>

<p>“No, I promise not to peep,” said Rose,
and obediently she went to bed and closed
her eyes tight, and before she knew it she
was sound asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>Rose slept and slept and slept, later than
usual. And it was not until the old clock
called out, “One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, <i>eight</i>!” that she opened her eyes with
a pop and stared at him hard. How could a
clock speak without a face? But there the old
fellow stood, smiling at her as usual, with his
hands pointing up and down quite correctly.</p>

<p>“Then it was only a dream after all!”
sighed Rose, and there were two tears in her
eyes as she thought of the little sister whom
she had hoped to see this morning. “There
wasn’t any Fairy Queen, and I didn’t go about
last night collecting eyes and ears and hands
for a new baby. Oh, dear! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>Just then there was a knock on the door,
and Papa came into the room. “Wake up,
my little Rose,” he said, “and see what I
have to show you here! Something came in
the night, something new and nice that you
have wanted for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Papa,” gasped Rose, “what is it?
Not a—not a little sister?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Papa looked surprised. “Why, how did
you guess, Rose?” he asked. “That is just
what it is.” And he beckoned to Eliza, Rose’s
own old nurse, who came into the room with
a tiny bundle in her arms. And there, wrapped
in soft flannel, was the pinkest, prettiest, cunningest
little baby you ever saw!</p>

<p>“Oh, Papa!” cried Rose, clapping her
hands. “It wasn’t a dream after all. I did
collect the pieces. Oh, I am so glad!”</p>

<p>Papa looked puzzled, but Rose had no
time now to explain about the Fairy Queen.
She was too busy examining the little pink
bundle to see if it was all there as she had
planned. Yes, there were the eyes and ears,
the little hands and nails, all quite evenly
matched. This was no crooked, carelessly
patched baby, this little sister of Rose’s. The
fairies had smoothed out all the pieces and
made them beautiful, and, as the Queen had
promised, there was not one seam to show
how it had been done. Oh, how proud Rose
was of the dear little nose and the pink mouth!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Suddenly her face clouded. The baby had
opened its pink mouth wide to let out a
babyish howl, and Rose saw a dreadful sight.
There was not a single tooth there!</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” cried Rose, “I forgot her
<i>teeth</i>. And there was my comb lying on the
bureau conveniently all the time. Oh, how
careless I was! Poor little Sister!” and she
burst out crying.</p>

<p>Nurse and Papa assured Rose that it was
quite fashionable for a baby to be toothless at
first; that the little sister’s teeth would come
soon enough. But Rose could not believe it.
She felt sure that she had spoiled the baby,
who would never be quite finished like other
children. It was only when, some months
later, Papa and Nurse turned out to be right
and Rose felt the little hard teeth pushing
through the baby’s gums that she became
quite happy and relieved.</p>

<p>“I think that this was the Fairy’s doings,
too!” said Rose. And indeed, that did not
seem more wonderful than the fact which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Rose could never explain,—that no one had
missed the nose of the teakettle, nor the neck
of Mamma’s white vase, nor any of the other
things which Rose had collected to piece the
baby. For, like the clock’s hands and face,
they were all in place as usual the very next
morning after that exciting night. But, as
Aunt Claire said, of course it is useless trying
to explain anything which has to do with the
fairies. Is it not so?</p>

<small>THE ALARM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Captain Prout said to Kenneth,
“How’d ye like to go out with me
to-morrow morning to catch bait for my lobster
traps? We’ll have to start early,—right
early for a little city feller like you. What do
you say to four o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can get up at four o’clock just as
easily as at seven,” said Kenneth proudly; “of
course I will go with you, Captain Prout.”</p>

<p>The Captain chuckled. “’Tain’t so easy
as you think, to git up at sunrise, when you
ain’t used to it,” he said; “but you kin set an
alarm, I guess. You ask your father, an’ if he
says you can go, I’ll take you off from the
beach in my boat to-morrow morning at four-fifteen;
that is, pervided you’re there, Sonny.”</p>

<p>Of course he would be there! Kenneth
asked his father if he might go, and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Thornton was quite willing, for he knew that
Captain Prout would be careful of the little
boy. Kenneth did not tell his father how
early he must start. But without troubling
any one he set the alarm clock at four, and
put it under the bed, so that it would be sure
to waken him in due season.</p>

<p>Now, very early the next morning, when
every one in the Thornton cottage was sleeping
soundly, two little figures came walking
up through the woods towards the back door.
The little boy carried a pail of milk, and the
little girl walked beside him, and they looked
something like the children whom you see
in the full moon,—Jack and Jill. But these
were not Jack and Jill. They were Tommy
and Mary Prout, Captain Prout’s twins, and
it happened to be their turn to bring the milk
that morning to the Thornton cottage for
Kenneth’s and Rose’s breakfast. I don’t know
what Kenneth and Rose would have done if
the little Prouts had forgotten to come with
the milk. But they never forgot, not once,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
all summer. There were six of them—three
boys and three girls—and every morning in
July and August, whether it rained or shone,
two of them came two miles from Lobster
Cove with the milk. And they came very
early,—so early that no one in the cottage
ever saw them do it. They were glad of this,
for they were very bashful. Whenever they
were out in the woods or along the shore and
heard any one coming, they always scuttled
away and hid like little frightened animals.</p>

<p>Sometimes Kenneth and Rose spied one or
two of these children running away through
the woods, but they had scarcely ever seen
their faces, and did not know one from
another. They called them just “the little
Prouts,” and thought them very queer.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i155">
<img class="w100" src="images/i155.jpg" alt="THEY WERE TOMMY AND MARY PROUT">
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">THEY WERE TOMMY AND MARY PROUT</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But the little Prouts knew Kenneth and
Rose much better. They often watched them
from a distance, when Kenneth and Rose did
not know. And they thought the Thornton
children the most wonderful creatures that
ever lived, and their toys and their doings the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
finest ever known. For you see, the little
Prouts had no toys of their own, and were very
different from Kenneth and Rose in every
way, except in being little brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Tommy and Mary, who were just the age of
Kenneth, came stealing very quietly through
the woods with the pail of milk, which they
carried around to the back door and set upon
the step, ready for Katie to take it when she
came down to get breakfast. They had done
their errand, and now were they not ready
to tramp home? Oh, no! They stood for a
minute listening, to be sure that no one was
stirring in the cottage, and then very softly
they tiptoed around to the front of the house,
where the broad piazza was. Sometimes the
city children left their toys all night out on
the piazza. The little Prouts knew this, for
they had often before done just this same thing
in the early morning after their long tramp
with the milk.</p>

<p>It was such a fine night that Rose had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
swung her doll’s hammock on the piazza, and
Alice, her beautiful new doll, was sleeping
here very sweetly. Rose had heard that it
was good for children to sleep in the open air.
Kenneth had left his express wagon and his
rocking-horse out here, too.</p>

<p>The little Prouts stood at the foot of the
piazza steps, staring up at these wonderful
things.</p>

<p>At last Mary Prout reached out her hand
and touched her brother. “Ain’t I dreaming?”
she said. “No, I ain’t. But Tommy!
Ain’t they beautiful!”</p>

<p>Tommy took a step towards the piazza and
paused, listening. There was no sound in the
house. “Let’s go up,” he whispered. “No
one will ever know. Come on.”</p>

<p>The two children stole noiselessly up the
steps and crept over the piazza to the sheltered
nook where the toys were safe from the dew.
Mary sank down on her knees beside Alice.
“Oh, oh!” she breathed. “I never saw anything
so beautiful!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Tommy was looking eagerly at the rocking-horse.
“Oh, how I wish ’t I dared ride
on him, just once!” he thought. He reached
out his hand to stroke the mane of the beautiful
creature, the like of which he had never
before seen. And at the same moment Mary
stretched a trembling hand towards Alice’s
golden curls. Think of having a doll like that
for your very own, to kiss and play with, and
carry around wherever you went! If only she
might have it in her arms just once, Mary felt
that she should be happy all the rest of her
days.</p>

<p>But just at that moment there came a terrible
sound, “Pr-r-r-jingle-jangle! P-r-r-r-r!
Jang-jang!” In the stillness it seemed to
sound louder than the loudest thunder. Tommy
started as if he had been shot. Poor Mary
drew back her hand as if Alice’s yellow curls
had burned them. “Pr-r-r-jang-jang!” The
dreadful noise continued, and it came from
inside the house.</p>

<p>With one frightened leap Tommy and Mary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
were down the piazza steps. Casting one wild
look behind to see if they were being followed
by the terrible creature that was growling to
warn and punish them for daring to touch
those precious treasures, they fled away like
foxes across the garden and into the woods at
the back of the house. Poor little frightened
things! They thought that their early-morning
secret had been discovered, and never
again would they dare to venture near that
piazza which was the only fairyland that they
knew.</p>

<p>Meanwhile what was going on inside the
house? “Pr-r-r-jang-jang!” The alarm clock
still buzzed away fiercely. Kenneth had
wound it up as far as it would go, and for
several minutes the bell rang, until every one
in the house, except Kenneth himself, was
wide awake.</p>

<p>Papa and Mamma woke up instantly. Mrs.
Thornton’s first thought was about the new
baby. “Oh, John!” she cried, “has anything
happened to the baby? Do call Eliza.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Mr. Thornton was already out of bed. “It
can’t be burglars,” he said, “for we haven’t
any burglars down here on the island, nor any
burglar alarm, either. Don’t be frightened.
I will go and look through the house.”</p>

<p>In the hall he met Aunt Claire and the
servants, shivering in their wrappers. “Oh,
John,” cried Aunt Claire, “is the house afire?
I certainly heard a fire-alarm.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Mr. Thornton. “It
must be some one pulling the door-bell.” But
when he went down to open the door, with
the servants following in a frightened, huddled
group, there was no one waiting outside.
The piazza was empty. Only Alice swung
peacefully in her hammock, seeming not the
least frightened.</p>

<p>“It is very strange,” muttered Mr. Thornton.
“It certainly seemed to me inside the
house.”</p>

<p>In the hall outside the nursery he met old
Eliza, the nurse.</p>

<p>“Have you been into Master Kenneth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
room?” she asked. “I thought the noise
came from there, though I don’t see how it
could be so.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be, of course,” said Mr. Thornton,
but he went into Kenneth’s room, where
the boy was still sleeping soundly. It was just
at this moment that Kenneth at last woke up.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” he murmured,
blinking sleepily. “What is the matter,
Papa?”</p>

<p>“We heard a bell ring,” said his father,
“and Eliza thought that it came from here.
Did you hear it?”</p>

<p>“No, Papa,” said Kenneth drowsily, “I
didn’t hear any bell,” and turning over he
went fast asleep again. It was a quarter past
four, and Captain Prout was just rowing away
from the beach, where he had looked in vain
for his little passenger.</p>

<p>“I knew he would forgit to come!” he
chuckled.</p>

<p>From Kenneth’s room Mr. Thornton went
to Rose’s. He found her standing by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
window in her little blue wrapper, looking
out towards the woods.</p>

<p>“Oh, Papa, what is it?” she said eagerly.
“Do you think it was the fairies?”</p>

<p>“Fairies? Why, what makes you think it
was fairies?” asked Mr. Thornton, “though
I must confess that I don’t know what else it
could have been.”</p>

<p>“I looked out of the window,” said Rose,
“and I saw two little creatures run into the
woods as fast as they could go. One was a
little girl and one was a little boy, and I think
they were fairies who had been ringing our
door-bell.”</p>

<p>“Pooh-pooh! Fairies don’t ring doorbells,”
said her father. “And at this time in
the morning it isn’t likely that any of the
island children were ringing our bell and running
away, as the naughty boys do in the city
sometimes. I don’t understand it at all. But
the noise has stopped, so let us finish our naps,
as Kenneth is doing. He is the wisest of us
all, not to bother his head about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>And so they all went back to bed and slept
soundly until breakfast time.</p>

<p>At the breakfast table the first thing Kenneth
said was,—</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness me! I was going to fish
with Captain Prout at four o’clock in the
morning. But I didn’t wake up. How he
will laugh at me! But why didn’t my alarm
clock go off?”</p>

<p>“<i>Alarm clock?</i>” said his father. “So you
set the alarm, did you? Well, that accounts
for everything. What a sleepy head you are,
Kenneth!”</p>

<p>Yes, that accounted for everything, except
for Rose’s fairies. They never were accounted
for. And indeed, those poor little fairies never
again dared visit that scene of their terrible
early-morning alarm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>BROTHERS AND SISTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE summer passed away only too
quickly, as summers do, and almost before
the children knew it the fall had come,
and it was time to go back to the city to school.
It was very hard for Kenneth and Rose to leave
the island, with all its beautiful playgrounds
and wonderful playthings, so different from
what one has in the city. And yet it was
pleasant to be back in the city, too, to see all
their little friends again, and to begin new
studies at school. Kenneth and Rose soon forgot
to long for the beach, and the rocks, and
the woods behind their little summer home,
they were so happy in their other home in the
city. They scarcely ever thought of the island
nowadays, and when they did it seemed very
far away and unreal, almost like an island in
a dream. They forgot that there were people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
still living there to whom this was the only
home; people who would be there all through
the long winter, when the rough winds would
sweep through those evergreen trees, <i>whew!</i>
so loudly, and the waves would dash up over
the bare rocks, <i>splash!</i> so fiercely, while all
the island lay cold and dreary and deserted,
wrapped in a blanket of snow.</p>

<p>One rainy Saturday morning Mrs. Thornton
was dusting the shelves in the play-room
closet, where the children’s books lived.
“Oh, dear!” she sighed, “It is such a bother
to take care of all these old magazines! I
wish I knew some one who would like these
papers after you children have finished reading
them.”</p>

<p>“All the other children have more books
of their own than they can read,” said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said his mother. “But there
might be <i>some one</i> who would be so glad to
have the pictures and stories, if only we could
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Rose was playing with her dolls in the
window seat, when she had a sudden idea.</p>

<p>“Mamma!” she cried, clapping her hands.
“Why can’t we send them away off down
to the island where the little Prouts live?
Don’t you think the little Prouts would like
the magazines?”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea, Rose,” said her
mother. “I fancy the poor little things never
see a magazine. They will be sure to like
the pictures, anyway, whether they can read
or not. I wonder if any of them can read?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what their names are,”
said Rose, “but there are ever so many of
them, boys and girls. Mamma, I should like
to send my magazine to the little girl Prouts.”</p>

<p>“And I will send mine to the Prout boys,”
said Kenneth promptly. “Won’t they be
glad to see it coming, every week?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed they will,” said Mrs. Thornton.
“And you must be sure not to disappoint
them. If you are going to send the
magazines at all, I want you to do it regularly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
every week. It will be a good practice
lesson in remembering. Promise not to forget,
children, if I let you send the papers this
time?”</p>

<p>“We promise, Mamma, we promise,” said
Kenneth and Rose. And that promise was the
beginning of a very interesting thing.</p>

<p>Every week after that, when they had
finished reading their two magazines, Kenneth
and Rose rolled them up, each in brown
stamped wrapper, and Rose wrote on hers in
big letters, “The Misses Prout,” and Kenneth
wrote on his “The Masters Prout,” and they
sent them away down to the island in Maine.
It wasn’t much trouble to do that. But my!
you should have seen what pleasure it gave
the little Prouts.</p>

<p>All the year round, in summer and in
winter, too, the little Prouts lived with their
father, Captain Prout, in a tiny cottage on
the island, close beside the sea. It was a very
nice place in the summer; for then, like Kenneth
and Rose, they were happy all day long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
playing out of doors, fishing and picking berries.
But best of all, they enjoyed carrying
the milk to the Thornton cottage on the cliff,
two miles away. For then they sometimes
had a peep at the wonderful things which the
strangers had brought to the island, and at
the two children playing at games which were
so different from any ever before seen thereabout.
The little Prouts used almost to quarrel
over their turns to carry the milk.</p>

<p>But in the fall the summer people sailed
away. Then the little Prouts went to school
for a time, as they did in the spring; and that
was pleasant, too. But in the winter there was
no school, because of the cold and the deep
snow, and the long road which the island
children had to travel to the schoolhouse in
the village. Also it was hard to get a teacher
for these bitter winter months. The winters
were lonely enough for the little Prouts. They
seldom saw any other children, and there
was not much for them to do except housework
and patchwork and knitting, and helping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
father to mend nets and make lobster-pots
for the next summer.</p>

<p>The little Prouts had few playthings. They
hardly knew what playthings were. They
had seen Kenneth’s express wagon and rocking-horse,
and Rose’s beautiful dolls on the
piazza of the cottage. They had almost dared
to touch the wonderful things one early morning;
but a terrible alarm had warned them
away, so they knew that these marvelous and
lovely things were not meant for children
like themselves. They thought that the city
people were a different kind of creature.</p>

<p>Tom and Mary and Susan knew how to
read, but they had no books. On the island
people did not read much, because there were
no books. In some houses there was not even
a Bible. There was no public library. There
was no Sunday-school library, for there was
not even a church on the island. In summer
a minister came there to spend his vacation,
and he preached every Sunday on the hill-top
near the village. But in winter every one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
even the minister, seemed to forget the island.
The little Prouts were very ignorant, and they
wondered if the Lord himself forgot the
island in the dreary months of snow and cold.</p>

<p>“Of course He forgets,” said Tommy,
when they were talking about it one day.
“He lives in the city, and comes down here
only in the summer, just as the city people
do.”</p>

<p>“But He must remember us,” sighed little
Polly. “The minister said He was our
Father.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Tommy scornfully. “He
ain’t our Father, either! You know he ain’t.
He is <i>their</i> Father in heaven. I heard them
talking to Him, one day, on the hill.”</p>

<p>“But the minister said He was everybody’s
Father, Tommy,” answered Mary wistfully.</p>

<p>“But how <i>can</i> He be?” argued Tommy.
“He is the Father of Kenneth and Rose
Thornton, and of people like them who live
in the city. He can’t be our Father, too; for
if He was, we should be the brothers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
sisters of Kenneth and Rose. And you know
we ain’t that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! We ain’t that!” echoed all the
little Prouts sadly, and then they were silent
for a long time. The little girls sighed,
and their lips trembled. They admired Rose
Thornton more than anybody they had ever
seen. Many and many a time when Rose did
not know it, the little Prout girls were peeping
at her from behind some big tree in the
woods or rock on the shore; wondering at
her long, golden curls and at her pretty, pink
skin, which never seemed to grow brown and
rough like theirs, and at the simple little
dresses, which seemed wonderfully beautiful
to them. Rose’s blue cambric frock with the
red leather belt and red hair-ribbon was their
favorite.</p>

<p>The Prout boys thought that Kenneth was
the most wonderful person, with his bicycle
and his Indian suit and bow and arrows.
But they never dreamed of speaking to Rose
or to Kenneth. They were ashamed even to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
be seen by them, and always ran away and
hid, especially after that terrible morning of
the early alarm. Oh, no! Of course these
children could not be their brothers and
sisters!</p>

<p>It was at the end of that very same day,
the longest, dreariest day of early winter,
when the little Prouts had agreed that the
Father had forgotten the island, that the
magazines began to come. Tim Parks drove
four miles from the village to bring them, he
was so curious to know who could have been
sending things to “The Masters Prout” and
“The Misses Prout.” For no one had ever
before sent any mail to the Prout family.
These were postmarked from the city, too!</p>

<p>“Something for the Masters Prout, and
something for the Misses Prout!” he called
out as he pushed open the door. “I thought
I’d jest bring ’em over for ye.” And he
handed the packages to Tommy and Mary.</p>

<p>What an excitement there was then! They
tore open the wrappers, and behold! A boy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
magazine and a girl’s magazine, full of pictures
and stories. The children danced around,
shouting and laughing. Somebody had sent
them papers from the city! They were not
quite forgotten!</p>

<p>“Who sent ’em? That is what I want to
know,” said Tim Parks.</p>

<p>But there was no word or scrap of writing
to tell, and Tim could not find out what he
longed to know.</p>

<p>“Wall, I guess they jest came from the
magazine shop,” said Tim at last, as he went
out of the door. But the children looked at
one another. They knew better.</p>

<p>“You said He had forgotten, and He sent
these to show He hasn’t,” whispered Mary
to Tom. And the children looked at the
papers with a feeling of awe and pride.</p>

<p>What continued joy there was for the little
Prouts in those generous pages! Mary and
Tom read every word aloud to the others,
and to the whole family; for the father and
mother were as much interested as the children.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
There was a continued story, and that
was the most exciting of all. For it was one
of the best stories that Aunt Claire had ever
written. But, alas! it stopped short at the
most thrilling part.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Mary, when she had
read the last word aloud to her big-eyed
audience. “Why does it stop? Now we shall
never know how the Princess got out of
the Giant’s castle!”</p>

<p>Those papers lasted the little Prouts for a
whole week. And they had not begun to tire
of them when—another set of magazines
came! Captain Prout happened to go to the
village that day, and Tim Parks came running
out to him from the post-office.</p>

<p>“More mail for the Misses and the Masters
Prout, Cap’n!” he called. “I guess your
children are goin’ to have ’em come reg’lar.
Ain’t it wonderful who sends ’em?”</p>

<p>What a shriek of joy went up from the
little Prouts when they saw what Father
brought them that night! “Now we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
know about the Princess!” cried Mary, and
they could hardly wait for supper to be over
before they continued the wonderful tale.
This part was to be continued also; but there
was no such wail of anguish when the last
word was read.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’s sorry it’s done,” sighed little
Polly; “but I guess the rest will come next
week. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>And somehow, even Tommy was hopeful
this time. “Yes, I guess He hasn’t forgotten
us, quite,” he confessed to Mary before they
went to bed.</p>

<p>If only Kenneth and Rose could have seen
what joy their story papers gave to the little
Prouts! Every week through all that bitter
winter, in sun or in shine, through snow and
sleet, as regularly as a Saturday came, one of
the Prouts tramped four miles to the village
for the precious magazines. And always the
other little Prouts were waiting breathlessly
for him to return, fearful lest this time the
papers might not have come. They were
always looking out of the window, a row of
little heads, one above another.</p>

<p class="caption">WHAT A SHRIEK OF JOY WENT UP</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Did it come?” they would cry, making
signs of eager question as soon as the messenger
appeared in sight, and he would shout
and wave the two wrappers over his head,
whereat all the children would begin to jump
up and down with joy.</p>

<p>It would have been a dreadful thing if
Kenneth or Rose had once forgotten to send
the papers. But they never did, though they
could not guess how much depended upon
their remembering that simple little promise
which they had made.</p>

<p>No, Kenneth and Rose could not possibly
know what the sharing of that single one of
their pleasures meant to the little Prouts, and
to all the other island children besides,—for
in the end the whole island saw the magazines.
They were passed on from family to
family all that winter, and were literally worn
to rags by the thumbing of many little fingers,
and big ones, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>The Prouts were learning a great deal about
many things, nowadays. It was almost as good
as going to school. All that winter they lived
in a new world of constant change. The little
cottage was no longer dreary or lonely. Their
stupid tasks were no longer tiresome, for they
had the beloved magazines to read when all
was done. They had the children of those
stories for their companions and friends, and
they began to understand, ever so dimly, that
all the children of the world are little brothers
and sisters to one another.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>TOMMY’S LETTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day they were talking about it, all
together.</p>

<p>“God is our Father, as the preacher said,”
declared Mary. “I read it to-day in the
magazine, don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Tommy, “it must be He
who sends the papers to us, for nobody else
knows about us. But He knows everything,—the
preacher said so.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could thank Him,” said little
Polly. “He has been so good not to forget
us.”</p>

<p>“I am going to write to Him,” said Tommy
suddenly; “there is a Letter-Box in the paper,
and boys and girls write to it every week. I
am going to write and tell the Lord how we
thank Him.”</p>

<p>And forthwith Tommy sat down and wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to the magazine a letter something like those
which he read every week in the Letter-Box,—yet
different. An island letter would have
to be different. This is what Tommy wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lucky Island, Maine.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Magazine</span>,—You kum evry weak,
an i dono ow we got long witout You. The
aint nobody in the Sity to tel You how to get
to This jumpin-of plais, so we no that Our
Father must send You evry weak. An we
wanter Thanx him but we dono ow. Plees
put this Leter in the Leterbox sos he wil see.
He dont kum here in Wintr its so lonsum I
gess he wood be glad if he knu ow hapy he
made 6 litl chilren way down in Maine. I
hop he will send it evr an evr we havnt nothin
els to red.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours truly,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Tommy Prout</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The editor of the magazine did not often
print a letter spelled as badly as this one of
poor Tommy Prout, who was eight years old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
but who only went to school in the spring
and fall. But when the editor read that letter
he blew his nose and wiped his glasses and
said:—</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll print your letter just as it is,
Tommy Prout, and I think it will please Him
whom you wish to thank, even if some one
else mails the paper for Him every week.”</p>

<p>So that is why, some days later, when Kenneth
Thornton was carelessly cutting the leaves
of his new magazine, he suddenly gave a surprised
whistle. The name of his beloved
summer island had caught his eye, at the head
of a letter in the Letter-Box.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma,” he cried, “see, here is a
letter from our island. And it is signed,
‘Tommy Prout.’ But I can’t make out the
funny spelling.”</p>

<p>Then Kenneth’s mamma read the letter
aloud, and it did not sound so queer as it
looked. When she had finished there were
tears in her eyes and in Rose’s, too. And
Kenneth was winking queerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“The dear little fellow!” said Mamma.
“Just think what it means to them to have
those papers that you don’t care for. O children,
our Father surely did put it into your
heads to send the magazines; so Tommy is
right.”</p>

<p>“And we will send them ‘ever and ever,’
as Tommy hopes, won’t we, Kenneth?” cried
Rose eagerly.</p>

<p>“Course we will,” said Kenneth promptly.</p>

<p>“I’d like to write a letter to the little girl
Prouts,” mused Rose. “It must be awfully
lonesome on the island in winter.”</p>

<p>“We must wait till next summer, Rose
dear,” said her mamma. “We have been bad
neighbors to those little children, and we
must get acquainted with them first. The
little Prouts do not know us, and it is our
fault. But another summer we will know
them. And then we will plan what we can
do to make their winters less lonely. Poor
babies!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to send them a Christmas box,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
said Kenneth, who had been thinking all this
time. “I’ll send the boys a lot of books and
candy and things.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll send some to the girls,” cried
Rose, clapping her hands. “Oh! That will
be fine,—and a doll for each one.”</p>

<p>“That is a good plan,” said Mrs. Thornton.
“We will certainly do it. How selfish
we have been to care for our beautiful island
only while we were there, and to forget our
neighbors who live there all the year through!
Just think, Kenneth and Rose, those children
believe that our Father doesn’t come there
in winter. We must change that, and show
them that He is watching all His children all
the time.”</p>

<p>Kenneth and Rose had a beautiful time
making ready that Christmas box. Into it
they put all the things that they had first
thought of, and a great many beside. And
they sent it so that it reached the island on
Christmas eve. Tim Parks brought it over
to the Prouts the next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“I guess your friend who sends you the
magazines has sent you something fine for
Christmas,” he grinned, as he carried the
heavy box into the room where the six little
Prouts stood gaping with wonder. “‘The
Misses and the Masters Prout!’” he cried,
reading the label.</p>

<p>Mary squeezed Tommy’s hand and whispered
something as they all crowded around
while the box was being opened. And Tommy
nodded wisely.</p>

<p>On the top of the box, inside, was a card
which read: “Merry Christmas to the little
Prouts, from a brother and a sister who read
Tommy’s letter in the Letter-Box. The kind
Father watches over us all alike, on islands
and in the big cities, and He bids us love
one another, especially on His birthday.”</p>

<p>A brother and a sister in the city! That
news was almost more welcome than the box
itself. If Kenneth and Rose could have seen
those six little Prouts and have heard their
squeals of joy when the box was unpacked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
they would have been glad indeed that they
had remembered to be brotherly and sisterly.</p>

<p>The magazines which kept coming “ever
and ever” and the books that were in that
Christmas box were the beginning of the
Island Public Library, of which every one is
now so proud, and of many other good things
which happened to the island and especially
to the little Prouts.</p>

<p>For in summers after that they grew to
know and to love their neighbors, the city
children. Kenneth and Rose have been a
good brother and sister to the little Prouts
ever since; and it is as good a fortune for
Kenneth and Rose as it is for the little Prouts.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
